                "<p>Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has been inducted into the prestigious Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, cementing his place among the country&#39;s cricketing legends. At 43, Clarke received the honour on Thursday, nearly a decade after retiring from international cricket. He becomes the 64th player to be inducted, with two more names to be added later this season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s remarkable career began when he made his first-class debut for New South Wales at just 17 years old. Over the course of his career, Clarke captained Australia to victory in the 2015 ODI World Cup and led the national team in 47 of his 115 Test matches. He scored 8,643 runs in Tests, ranking sixth on Australia&#39;s all-time list, and 7,981 runs in ODIs, where he stands fourth. Clarke&rsquo;s 28 Test centuries also place him sixth in that category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s rise to prominence came swiftly. After impressing with the bat in One Day Internationals, he announced his arrival in Test cricket during Australia&rsquo;s 2004 tour of India, where he was named Player of the Match for his debut 151-run knock in Bengaluru. Despite a brief dip in form and being dropped in 2005, Clarke returned to the fold as an even more formidable player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He became only the sixth Australian to score a Test triple-century, posting an unbeaten 329 against India at the SCG during the 2011-12 series. Clarke followed that with a double century in the same series and two more against South Africa the following year. His standout performances also included a memorable 151 against South Africa in Cape Town in 2011 and a defiant 161 on the same ground in 2014, where he played through a broken shoulder to help Australia reach the No. 1 ranking in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of his most emotional innings came in 2014, when Clarke scored 128 against India in Adelaide just days after the tragic death of his close friend, Phillip Hughes. That match would be Clarke&rsquo;s final home Test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke, who succeeded Ricky Ponting as captain in 2011, led Australia to an Ashes whitewash in 2013-14. His tenure as captain ended after Australia&rsquo;s loss in the 2015 Ashes series in England. At the peak of his career, Clarke was ranked the No. 1 batter in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reflecting on his career and induction, Clarke expressed his pride at joining the Hall of Fame alongside cricketing idols he admired as a child. &quot;Retirement does a lot of things to you,&quot; Clarke said. &quot;When you play at the highest level, people talk about your international career, but for me, it started at six years of age. I retired at 34, so it was my life. It&#39;s still a part of my life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter King, chairman of the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, praised Clarke as a player who &ldquo;defined his generation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Michael&#39;s extraordinary first-class playing career started at just 17 at the SCG - the place where many of his highlights occurred, including a Test triple-century against India in 2012,&rdquo; King said. &ldquo;Michael&#39;s career will forever be remembered fondly by the Australian public and his standing held alongside those at the upper echelon of our game.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to his batting feats, Clarke was also a capable left-arm spinner, taking key wickets throughout his career. One of his memorable moments came in 2008 when he took 3 for 5 in just 1.5 overs against India, helping Australia retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and extend their record-equalling 16-match Test winning streak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s legacy, both as a player and a leader, will forever be etched in Australian cricket history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Abhishek Sharma&#39;s meteoric rise in Indian cricket has been nothing short of impressive. After a blistering couple of years in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the 24-year-old&rsquo;s call-up to the Indian T20I squad was backed by his consistent performances, most notably a match-winning 79 off 34 balls against England in Kolkata. However, despite these successes, Abhishek has faced some struggles, including eight instances of being dismissed for under 20 in his first 12 T20I innings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition for top-order spots in India&#39;s batting line-up is intense, adding pressure on a young player like Abhishek, who is still carving out his place. But the young batter has remained undeterred, attributing his continued success to the guidance and confidence instilled in him by the team&#39;s leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent press conference, Abhishek revealed the role of India&rsquo;s captain and coach in keeping his mindset positive. &ldquo;I have always thought from the start to be a team player,&rdquo; Abhishek said. &ldquo;In India, there will always be a lot of competition when it comes to selection, but when Suryakumar Yadav and Gautam Gambhir tell me to always keep my intent, that was a big moment for me. When the team wants me to do that, then I can do it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He further added that the support from his captain and coach, even during lean patches, has been crucial in maintaining his confidence. &quot;When the captain or coach say this, you get confidence and back yourself.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having worked with some of the game&#39;s greats, including Yuvraj Singh, Brian Lara, and now Gautam Gambhir, Abhishek credits their mentorship for helping him express himself freely on the field. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m very lucky in this. I&rsquo;ve been working with Yuvi paaji at first. Going forward, I had Brian Lara, who really helped me at SRH. Moving forward, Dan Vettori was pretty simple; he just wanted everyone to express themselves, and I think that gave me the freedom to play my shots,&rdquo; Abhishek explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking ahead to major tournaments, Abhishek shared his preparation strategy, which includes simulating match conditions in practice. &quot;I try and face the kind of bowlers I will potentially face in a match. Special mention to Kotzy sir [Sitanshu Kotak] and Abhishek Nayar bhai. Both helped me in the nets to get me similar bowlers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his individual brilliance with the bat, Abhishek was quick to credit India&#39;s spinners for their crucial role in restricting England to a modest total of 132 in Kolkata. He singled out Varun Chakravarthy as a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; for India. &ldquo;If you see the last few series, the way Varun has bowled, he has been a game changer for us. When you get good wickets all around in the T20 format, you have to have that bowler who bowls really well,&rdquo; Abhishek remarked, also praising Ravi Bishnoi and Axar Patel for their contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abhishek&rsquo;s fearless approach to batting and his ability to back his natural game, even in high-pressure situations, have made him a standout performer for India in recent matches. With support from his team and coaches, it seems he is well on his way to becoming one of India&rsquo;s most reliable T20I players.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>India captain Suryakumar Yadav chose to bowl first after winning the toss in the opening T20I of the five-match series against England at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. Dew is expected to play a significant role in the second innings, with the pitch described as &quot;sticky,&quot; potentially aiding the bowlers early on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Team Line-ups and Strategy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&#39;s skipper Jos Buttler, who also preferred to bowl first, unveiled a pace-heavy side for the clash. India, meanwhile, have adopted a spin-friendly strategy, with Axar Patel, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ravi Bishnoi forming a three-pronged spin attack. Additionally, left-arm orthodox spinner Abhishek Sharma adds a slower-bowling option to the line-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&#39;s pace contingent includes Arshdeep Singh, all-rounder Hardik Pandya, and debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy. Senior pacer Mohammed Shami, recovering from ankle surgery and a knee injury sustained during the 2023 ODI World Cup final, is yet to make his return to international cricket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transition and Recent Form</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The series marks a transitional phase for both teams. England&#39;s newly-appointed all-format head coach, Brendon McCullum, oversees his first white-ball match. India, under new head coach Gautam Gambhir, have been building on their T20 success, defeating Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and South Africa since their T20 World Cup victory last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&#39;s record at home in T20I series remains formidable, with no bilateral series losses over the past six years. The hosts also hold a dominant edge over England in this format, having won the last four bilateral series. Their previous encounter in the T20 World Cup semi-finals saw India cruise to a 68-run victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key Moments and Historical Context</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For England, this match at Eden Gardens brings back memories of the 2016 T20 World Cup final, where Carlos Brathwaite famously smashed four consecutive sixes off Ben Stokes in the last over to secure a dramatic win for the West Indies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playing XIs</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>India:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Sanju Samson (wk), 2.

            "content": [
                "<p>With the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy on the horizon, questions remain over whether India captain Rohit Sharma will travel to Pakistan for the traditional captains&#39; call, scheduled tentatively for February 16 or 17 in Karachi. As per ICC protocol, the captains&#39; event is typically held in the host country to kick off the tournament. However, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has yet to receive official communication from the ICC on the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It [Rohit travelling to Pakistan] has not yet been discussed. It is not on the agenda yet,&quot; said Devjit Saikia, the newly-appointed BCCI secretary, speaking to ESPNcricinfo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government Clearance Unclear</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is currently unclear whether the Indian government&rsquo;s approval will be required for Rohit Sharma to travel to Pakistan. Political tensions between India and Pakistan have prevented any bilateral cricket series since 2012, with both teams meeting only in ICC tournaments. While Pakistan has visited India for such events, India has not played any matches in Pakistan since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid Model in Place for Champions Trophy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to India&rsquo;s stance against traveling to Pakistan for their matches, the ICC, in coordination with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), introduced a hybrid hosting model for ICC events through 2027. Under this arrangement, Dubai will host all of India&rsquo;s matches in the Champions Trophy, including any knockouts if the team qualifies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PCB Seeks Standard Captains&#39; Event Protocol</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PCB has reportedly requested the ICC to ensure the participation of all team captains for standard pre-tournament events, including the photoshoot and opening ceremony. The ICC is still finalizing logistics and travel plans for the teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, there is precedent for BCCI officials visiting Pakistan. In 2023, BCCI President Roger Binny and Vice-President Rajiv Shukla attended an official dinner hosted by the PCB during the Asia Cup in Lahore. However, no recent example exists of Indian players traveling to Pakistan in an official capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternative Launch Models Considered</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should logistical or political challenges arise, the ICC may consider an alternative launch model. For instance, the captains&#39; event for the 2024 Men&#39;s T20 World Cup was skipped, and a lighting projection show featuring the captains&#39; images was conducted at the Rockefeller Center in New York City instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compliance with ICC Uniform Rules</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responding to reports of alleged objections by the BCCI to the host nation&rsquo;s name on player jerseys, Saikia clarified that India will adhere to all ICC uniform regulations. &quot;BCCI will follow every uniform-related ICC rule during the Champions Trophy. Whatever the other teams will do regarding the logo and dress code, we are going to follow in true letter and spirit,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As discussions continue, the cricketing world awaits clarity on whether Rohit Sharma will break the long-standing absence of Indian cricketers in Pakistan by attending the captains&#39; call, underscoring the challenges of navigating cricket amidst geopolitical tensions.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Steven Smith feared he had sustained a significant elbow injury last week while throwing during a Big Bash League match, a concern that could have disrupted Australia&#39;s plans for their upcoming tour of Sri Lanka. The injury occurred in the same elbow he had ligament surgery on in 2019, a procedure that required a lengthy rehabilitation process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith, who is set to captain Australia in the two-Test series in Galle with Pat Cummins on paternity leave, immediately worried he had re-injured the elbow. Describing the incident, Smith explained that he had just taken a catch off David Warner, flicked the ball back inside the boundary, and was throwing it in when he felt a sharp pain. &quot;Straight away I thought &#39;oh jeez, that hurt&#39;,&quot; Smith recalled. &quot;That was a similar sort of feeling to when I ruptured my ligament back in 2019, so I was a little bit worried.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After consulting a specialist and undergoing scans, Smith was cleared of any major injury to his repaired ligament. However, he did have some muscle damage and minor discomfort where the ligament meets the bone. Despite this, he has been cleared to join the Australian training camp in Dubai, where he arrived on Tuesday. Smith is planning to resume batting in the next couple of days and is confident he can play with some tape on the elbow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith believes the elbow issue may have been exacerbated by a blow to his shoulder from Jhye Richardson earlier in the BBL, which caused significant bruising and led him to adjust his throwing technique. While his throwing ability may be limited, Smith will primarily be used as a close catcher in the Sri Lanka series, which is expected to feature a lot of spin bowling, so his throwing capacity shouldn&#39;t be a major concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith is also set to begin the Sri Lanka series on the cusp of 10,000 Test runs, having been dismissed just short of the milestone twice during the final Test against India at the SCG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Australian squad, minus injured left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann, has now gathered in Dubai. Beau Webster and Mitchell Starc arrived alongside Smith, and the team is preparing on specially-designed pitches at the ICC Academy to replicate the conditions they expect to face in Sri Lanka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith noted the spin and bounce of the conditions in Dubai, saying, &quot;I was watching a bit there and there was a lot of variation in the spin and some bounce as well. That&rsquo;s the reason we are here, we are able to do what we want with these wickets, try and help guys develop game plans for when it gets extreme. It&rsquo;s going to hold us in good stead for the tour.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An update on Kuhnemann&rsquo;s availability is expected in the coming days after he underwent surgery for a compound fracture-dislocation of his right thumb sustained in the BBL.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>David Warner has played a pivotal role in reigniting the Sydney Thunder&#39;s belief, with coach Trevor Bayliss praising his leadership as the team makes a remarkable BBL comeback. A year ago, the Thunder were facing the prospect of reviewing one of the worst seasons in BBL history, having secured just one win &mdash; the lowest total for any team in a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, under Warner&rsquo;s leadership, the Thunder have surged into third place on the ladder, with a 5-3 record, and secured a top-four spot, setting up a knockout clash with the Melbourne Stars on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner, who is enjoying his first full BBL season, has been a standout performer, scoring the second-most runs of the tournament, including an unbeaten 88 against the ladder-leading Hobart Hurricanes. Had it not been for rain disrupting the Thunder&rsquo;s schedule, Warner could have topped the batting rankings, as the team played one less game than the Perth Scorchers, whose allrounder Cooper Connolly narrowly outscored Warner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bayliss acknowledged the immense value Warner has brought to the team, not just with his bat, but with his leadership and presence. &ldquo;The job he&rsquo;s done as captain is not just about his batting, it&rsquo;s his personality,&quot; Bayliss said. &quot;He&rsquo;s always up for it, he&rsquo;s a positive character. Loud, obnoxious sometimes, but the boys love it. I think it&rsquo;s the confidence he gives his teammates, and their belief that they&rsquo;re good enough to do the job. They&rsquo;re all good players; they sometimes just need that belief. The results have shown this year.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner&#39;s leadership has earned admiration from his teammates, including new recruit Sam Billings. Despite Warner&#39;s sometimes controversial past, including his involvement in the 2018 ball-tampering scandal, Billings sees a different side to the 38-year-old. &ldquo;People have this perception around him, but he&rsquo;s incredible in terms of the conversations he has with individuals and the consistent drive,&quot; Billings said. &quot;You see why he&rsquo;s one of the best players in the world, still at the age of 38. I&rsquo;m learning off him every day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their success, Warner believes the Thunder still have areas to improve ahead of their knockout clash against the Melbourne Stars. The team&#39;s largest partnership, an 89-run stand between Warner and Matthew Gilkes against the Perth Scorchers, ranks only 10th among the season&#39;s biggest partnerships. Additionally, the team lacks a bowler in the tournament&#39;s top 10 wicket-takers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The batters haven&rsquo;t all gelled together and gotten big partnerships,&quot; Warner noted. &quot;We talk about bowling partnerships as well; one has leaked at one end and then the other has taken wickets. We still haven&rsquo;t played a complete game yet, which for me is scary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Thunder prepare for their high-stakes encounter with the Stars at ENGIE Stadium, Warner&rsquo;s leadership and consistency continue to drive the team forward, with their fairytale run through the BBL season still alive and kicking.</p>\r\n"

However, given the nature of the Sri Lanka series, where spin is expected to dominate, Smith will likely be positioned as a close catcher, minimizing the need for heavy throwing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith will enter the Sri Lanka series just one run shy of 10,000 Test runs, having narrowly missed the milestone during the final Test against India at the SCG in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Australian squad is currently preparing in Dubai at the ICC Academy, where bespoke pitches are designed to replicate conditions expected in Sri Lanka. Smith noted the variation in spin and bounce observed during the early stages of the camp, which will help players develop strategies for challenging conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia&#39;s squad is now complete, excluding injured left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann, who is recovering from surgery after suffering a compound fracture-dislocation in his right thumb during the BBL. An update on Kuhnemann&rsquo;s recovery is expected in the coming days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the squad hard at work preparing for the upcoming tour, Smith&rsquo;s recovery brings relief to Australian fans, as the team prepares for what promises to be a tough series in Sri Lanka.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>India&rsquo;s T20I captain, Suryakumar Yadav, has reassured fans that the recent change in leadership, which saw Axar Patel promoted to vice-captain in place of Hardik Pandya, will not disrupt the dynamics within the team. Despite no longer holding the vice-captaincy role, Pandya remains a key figure in India&rsquo;s leadership group, according to Suryakumar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking ahead of the first T20I against England in Kolkata, Suryakumar emphasized his strong relationship with Hardik, who he described as a &quot;good friend&quot; and a vital part of the team&rsquo;s leadership structure. &quot;The relationship with him has been really great. We&#39;ve been playing together for a really long time. I still remember that from 2018, when I went back to Mumbai Indians [we first played together], and it&rsquo;s the same today,&quot; Suryakumar said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Pandya may not hold the formal title of vice-captain, Suryakumar was quick to affirm his continued involvement in key decision-making processes. &quot;We know what we want going forward with the India team. Axar has been given that added responsibility, but Hardik is also part of the leadership group. We have a lot of captains on the ground,&quot; Suryakumar added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suryakumar also reflected on his relationship with Gautam Gambhir, who became India&rsquo;s T20I coach in mid-2024. Under Gambhir&#39;s leadership, India has enjoyed significant success, winning T20I series against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and South Africa, losing just one game across those three series. &quot;I&#39;ve played under Gambhir for four years, so I know how he works,&quot; Suryakumar said. &quot;He gives freedom, allows players to express, and maintains a good atmosphere within the team.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking ahead, Suryakumar is focused on building a cohesive team for the 2026 T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka. However, he is not preoccupied with the long-term goal. &quot;The T20 World Cup is one year away, but I don&#39;t want to think about that yet,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to enjoy the journey to that event. It&#39;s important for the group to play lots of games leading up to it, and that&rsquo;s what Gauti bhai and I will focus on.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suryakumar also addressed the absence of Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul from the current T20I squad, confirming that Sanju Samson, who has been in excellent form with three T20I centuries in 2024, is India&rsquo;s first-choice wicketkeeper. &quot;Currently, there&#39;s no question mark on the wicketkeepers,&quot; he said. &quot;Sanju has done really well in the last 7-10 games and has shown what he&#39;s capable of. I&#39;m happy for him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As India prepares for the T20I series against England, Suryakumar emphasized the camaraderie within the squad, noting that the team&rsquo;s bond off the field would be reflected in their performances on the pitch. &quot;The atmosphere is great. We had a team dinner yesterday, and the boys know what their teammates like and don&rsquo;t like. This camaraderie will reflect on the field as well.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a strong leadership core, clear focus on the T20 World Cup, and a settled squad, India is poised to take on England in what promises to be an exciting T20I series.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>England&#39;s cricket team, renowned for its aggressive and deep batting line-up, is gearing up for a challenging T20I series against India in Kolkata, with sights set on next year&rsquo;s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. A formidable group of batters, combined with a coach who advocates an attacking style of play, has made England&rsquo;s side one of the most dangerous in world cricket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having enjoyed success in recent global tournaments, including their 2019 ODI World Cup victory and 2022 T20 World Cup triumph, England&rsquo;s strategy of maintaining batting depth has been a key factor in their dominance. This depth, from top-order batters to lower-order hitters, has allowed England to field teams capable of out-hitting the best bowling attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&rsquo;s captain Jos Buttler emphasized how the side&rsquo;s batting depth not only bolsters the tail end but also allows the top-order batters to play with greater freedom. &quot;We can be really aggressive and not worry too much about our wicket, because we&rsquo;ve got guys behind us who can do exactly the same job,&quot; Buttler said ahead of the Kolkata T20I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buttler also highlighted the significant batting prowess of England&rsquo;s bowlers, which further strengthens their line-up. &quot;We&rsquo;re really blessed with the bowlers we have here on this tour. They&rsquo;re all very capable batters,&quot; Buttler noted. &quot;Gus Atkinson has a Test hundred, Brydon Carse is an excellent hitter, and Adil Rashid, even at No. 11, has multiple first-class hundreds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a star-studded line-up, including the likes of Phil Salt, Ben Duckett, Buttler, Harry Brook, and Liam Livingstone, England&rsquo;s batting line-up is feared by all. The addition of Jacob Bethell, a rising star who has impressed in T20I cricket with an average of 57.66 and a strike rate of 167.96 in six innings, only adds to the team&#39;s firepower. Buttler expressed confidence in Bethell, saying, &quot;I think he&rsquo;s got a good head on his shoulders, and obviously, he&rsquo;s got the game for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bethell, who has been in fine form, notably smashing 87 off 50 balls for the Hobart Hurricanes in the 2024-25 Big Bash League, faces the challenge of adapting to Indian conditions, particularly against the spinners. However, Buttler is optimistic, noting that Bethell&rsquo;s talent has been recognized for a long time and his adaptability in international cricket is clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This series is also significant for Buttler personally, as he looks forward to working with Brendon McCullum, England&#39;s new white-ball coach. McCullum, who has overseen England&rsquo;s success in the Test format, now brings his aggressive philosophy to the limited-overs game. &quot;It&#39;s a really exciting tour, coming to India with a full line-up for us,&quot; Buttler said, stressing the importance of having a full-strength squad with no players needing rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With England&rsquo;s fast bowlers, including Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, injury-free, Buttler and McCullum are in the ideal position to build a strong, cohesive team as they prepare for the 2024 Champions Trophy and the T20 World Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s going to be a great series against a top side in their own conditions. There&rsquo;s a lot to look forward to,&quot; Buttler added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As England looks to defend their T20 World Cup crown and continue their success on the world stage, their explosive batting line-up and tactical depth are sure to make them a formidable opponent for India and beyond.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>Afghanistan&rsquo;s star legspinner, Rashid Khan, is set to make his return to One-Day Internationals for the first time since last year&rsquo;s World Cup. Rashid has been named in a 17-member squad for Afghanistan&rsquo;s upcoming three-match ODI series against South Africa in the UAE, marking his long-awaited comeback after months of injury rehabilitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The return of Rashid Khan is a significant boost for Afghanistan&rsquo;s bowling attack, especially as the team will continue to miss the services of mystery spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman. Mujeeb is still recovering from a sprained index finger on his right hand, and as a result, has been ruled out of the series. The team has also opted to leave out wristspinner Noor Ahmad, with chief selector Ahmad Shah Sulimankhil confirming that offspinner AM Ghazanfar, who made his ODI debut earlier this year, will cover for Mujeeb in the South Africa series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rashid&rsquo;s return follows a lengthy absence from international cricket after undergoing back surgery last year, which sidelined him for four months. During that period, he missed multiple assignments, including series against the UAE, India, Sri Lanka, and Ireland. He was also forced to withdraw from the Big Bash League (BBL), Pakistan Super League (PSL), and the SA20, before making his return in Afghanistan&rsquo;s T20I series against Ireland in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his surgery, Rashid has focused on T20 formats, playing in several high-profile leagues, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), the T20 World Cup, the Major League Cricket (MLC), and the Hundred. However, he struggled with back and hamstring injuries, which further delayed his full recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afghanistan&#39;s ODI squad for the series against South Africa also includes uncapped medium-pace bowler Bilal Sami, along with top-order batters Darwish Rasooli and Abdul Malik. While Rasooli has represented Afghanistan in seven T20Is, Malik has played two Tests but is yet to feature in ODIs. Sami has yet to make his international debut in any format. Malik&rsquo;s inclusion serves as cover for opening batter Ibrahim Zadran, who is nursing an ankle sprain that has kept him out of both the ongoing Test against New Zealand and the upcoming ODIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three-match ODI series against South Africa will take place in Sharjah, starting on September 18. This series will be the first-ever bilateral ODI encounter between Afghanistan and South Africa, with the two teams having previously met only in the 2019 and 2023 World Cups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The series also serves as crucial preparation for Afghanistan ahead of the 2024 Champions Trophy, for which the team qualified for the first time after finishing sixth in the league stage of the 2023 World Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Afghanistan Squad for South Africa ODIs:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hashmatullah Shahidi (capt), Rahmat Shah, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ikram Alikhil, Abdul Malik, Riaz Hassan, Darwish Rasooli, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Rashid Khan, Nangeyalia Kharote, AM Ghazanfar, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Bilal Sami, Naveed Zadran, Fareed Ahmad.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>Brendon McCullum&rsquo;s tenure as England&rsquo;s new white-ball head coach officially begins on Wednesday in Kolkata, with the former New Zealand captain promising to bring the same aggressive, entertaining style to the limited-overs format that has characterized his leadership of England&rsquo;s Test team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCullum&#39;s appointment, which was announced back in September, sees him take on the dual role of both red- and white-ball head coach, a position he has now officially stepped into following a successful spell overseeing England&#39;s Test tours of Pakistan and New Zealand. Marcus Trescothick had filled in as interim coach for the one-day team during McCullum&#39;s absence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCullum&#39;s first task is a challenging five-match T20 series against India, who were crowned T20 World Cup champions in 2023, followed by a three-match ODI series against the finalists of the 2023 50-over World Cup. England will then prepare for their Champions Trophy opener against Australia on February 22 in Lahore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking ahead of the first T20I at Eden Gardens, McCullum emphasized the importance of a free-flowing, attacking style of play, rather than focusing solely on victories. &ldquo;Obviously, we want to win every game we play, to try and be successful, and that&#39;s ultimately the mission for us,&rdquo; McCullum said. &ldquo;But our conversations and the language we use within the dressing room are quite different.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCullum highlighted England&rsquo;s powerful batting line-up, which he described as &quot;as powerful as anyone&#39;s in the world,&quot; and expressed his desire to build a cohesive, entertaining team with complementary skills. &ldquo;With the talent we have, there&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t play a really watchable brand of cricket,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the team&rsquo;s formidable bowlers and fielders as additional assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The England white-ball team is currently in the midst of a period of transition, having lost both the 50- and 20-over World Cup titles in 2023-24. However, McCullum&#39;s selections for the upcoming series indicate his intention to unify the Test and white-ball squads, with eight of the 15 players named in the ODI squad having featured in the Test team in 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key figures in McCullum&rsquo;s plans is captain Jos Buttler, who has been a fixture in the England white-ball set-up for years. Despite not having played a Test since 2021, Buttler&rsquo;s leadership is central to McCullum&rsquo;s vision for the team. McCullum, who has known Buttler for years through their time together in the IPL, believes the England captain is entering the prime of his career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;His best years are definitely ahead,&rdquo; McCullum stated. &ldquo;If you can let yourself go a little bit, with nothing to prove other than trying to get the best out of those around you, sometimes that can lift your game up a bit more.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCullum also confirmed that Buttler would relinquish the wicketkeeping gloves to focus on leading the team from the field. Phil Salt is expected to continue in the role behind the stumps, as he did during England&rsquo;s Caribbean tour in 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a double World Cup winner and at the age of 34, Buttler has little left to prove in the white-ball format. However, McCullum is confident that Buttler will thrive in his role as captain and that the next few years will be full of exciting opportunities for the 34-year-old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the series against India presents a tough challenge, McCullum is optimistic about England&rsquo;s prospects. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a tough tour. India are a very good team, particularly in their own conditions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we are very much focused on this series, knowing that it will set us up well for the Champions Trophy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&#39;s fans can expect to see an exciting, attacking style of cricket from the team under McCullum&rsquo;s leadership as they look to regain their momentum and build towards the upcoming Champions Trophy.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Glamorgan Cricket has appointed Richard Dawson as their interim head coach for the 2025 season, following the sudden exit of Grant Bradburn last month due to allegations of discriminatory behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dawson, who has extensive experience in both coaching and playing, was most recently part of the England Men&#39;s white-ball coaching team. He previously served as head coach of England Under-19s and enjoyed a successful tenure at Gloucestershire, where he guided the team to promotion from Division One in 2019 and led them to a T20 Finals Day appearance in 2020. Dawson also spent time with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), working on the performance pathway since 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m delighted to be joining Glamorgan as head coach for the coming season,&quot; Dawson commented. &quot;I&rsquo;ve got a good idea of how the club works having spent time with Welsh Fire over the years. I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting involved with the players and coaches at the club and building on the success achieved in the 50-over competition last season.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dawson&rsquo;s playing career, which included seven Test caps, was largely spent at Yorkshire, with short stints at Northamptonshire and Gloucestershire. Currently, he is working with the England Lions on their tour of Australia and will be involved in the Women&rsquo;s Premier League before taking up his new role with Glamorgan in March. Dawson will also continue as assistant coach for Welsh Fire during The Hundred competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Wallace, Glamorgan&#39;s director of cricket, expressed his satisfaction with the appointment: &quot;It&#39;s great news for the club that we have been able to appoint a coach of Richard Dawson&rsquo;s standing and quality as interim head coach until the end of the season. We were keen to move quickly and get someone in place for the 2025 season, and we see Richard as the perfect fit to develop the squad and continue to move us forward this season.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dawson&rsquo;s appointment is a key move for Glamorgan as they look to build on their recent successes, including their triumph in last year&rsquo;s One-Day Cup. The club will announce a replacement for the One-Day Cup role in due course.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite acknowledged the challenging conditions in the first Test against Pakistan, where the hosts prepared a dry, spinning pitch from the outset. While Brathwaite didn&rsquo;t shy away from addressing the pitch&rsquo;s impact, he emphasized that it was Pakistan&rsquo;s right to prepare the surface as they saw fit. Looking ahead to the second Test, which begins on January 25 in Multan, Brathwaite challenged his team to adapt better and deliver an improved performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We expect the same type of pitch in the second Test, and we&rsquo;ve got to come better,&quot; Brathwaite said at the post-match press conference. &quot;It was a difficult pitch to bat on for sure. But it&#39;s their decision how they want the pitch. We&#39;ve just got to come good.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the loss, Brathwaite found encouragement in the West Indies&rsquo; resilience throughout the first Test. While Pakistan&rsquo;s spinners, Sajid Khan and Noman Ali, claimed wickets, the standout performer for the visitors was left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican, who finished with remarkable figures of 7 for 32 in Pakistan&rsquo;s second innings. Warrican&rsquo;s match haul of 10 wickets for 101 runs was the third-best by a visiting bowler in a Test match in Pakistan, underlining his hard work and consistency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Jamal has worked extremely hard over the years, and it&rsquo;s good to see him get his first five-wicket haul. His hard work has paid off. He bowled well; he was consistent,&quot; Brathwaite said, wishing Warrican success for the second Test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the captain admitted there were areas for improvement, particularly in their bowling and batting. He noted that West Indies had allowed Pakistan to score an additional 50-60 runs in the first innings due to a lack of pressure on the batters. Brathwaite also pointed out the team&rsquo;s batting struggles, especially in the first innings where the top order failed to fire. He highlighted Alick Athanaze&rsquo;s fourth-innings 55, the highest individual score for West Indies, as an example of how the batters could improve their shot selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We gave them 50-60 runs too much in the first innings because the pitch spun from ball one, and we could have created enough pressure on the batters to get more wickets,&quot; Brathwaite reflected. &quot;Saying that, we also didn&#39;t bat as well as we could. Alick showed us today how easy it can be. You&#39;ve got to be braver in your shot selection.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brathwaite emphasized the need for a more all-round performance in the second Test, which could give West Indies a better chance of winning. Despite the margin of defeat, he believed the gap between the two teams was smaller than the scoreline suggested. Pakistan&rsquo;s strategy of preparing a turning pitch was clear, and both captains confirmed they expected similar conditions for the upcoming match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we could be better with the ball in the first innings. We gave them 50 runs too much, and we didn&rsquo;t bat as well as we could have, especially in the first innings,&quot; Brathwaite said. &quot;Pakistan only batted one session in their second innings too, and I think bowling-wise once we stay consistent in bringing batters onto the front foot, we&#39;ll have a better chance of limiting their first innings total. We&rsquo;ve got to bat better, we&rsquo;ve got to find a better way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The West Indies captain didn&rsquo;t commit to a specific strategy but acknowledged the team&rsquo;s growing use of aggressive tactics in their batting as the match progressed. Some players found success with reverse sweeps, while the most destructive phase with the bat came when the tenth-wicket partnership added 46 runs in just 21 balls, counterattacking Pakistan&rsquo;s spinners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The ball was ragging, so one is going to have your name on it regardless. The pitch was difficult, as you could see. It was very dry before even the game started. So I&#39;m not surprised with the game finishing early,&quot; Brathwaite said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As West Indies prepare for the second Test, Brathwaite is confident that his side can adapt and improve, with a renewed focus on consistency with both bat and ball.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>India&rsquo;s first training session ahead of their T20I series against England, which begins on January 22, was centered around fast bowler Mohammed Shami, whose fitness has been a major talking point over the past year. Shami, who has not featured in international cricket since the 2023 ODI World Cup final, was seen bowling with intensity during the practice session at Eden Gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite recovering from an ankle surgery, Shami had missed out on selection for the Border-Gavaskar Test series due to knee swelling. However, he returned to action on Sunday, bowling for over an hour with his knee strapped. Shami&rsquo;s progress was closely monitored by India&rsquo;s bowling coach Morne Morkel, who ensured that the pacer&rsquo;s fitness was on track for the upcoming matches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shami started his session by marking a good-length area on the practice pitches. He warmed up with a half run-up for over 20 minutes before transitioning to his full run-up. In the nets, Shami bowled to openers Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma, displaying encouraging signs of his fitness. Between his bowling spells, he also worked on short- and long-range catching with fielding coach T Dilip and head coach Gautam Gambhir. Shami concluded his session with a ten-minute spell, bowling at near full tilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 34-year-old pacer&rsquo;s fitness has been a concern for India for the last 12 months.

                "<p>Glenn Maxwell may not be heading to Sri Lanka with the Australian Test squad, but he&rsquo;s ensured a thrilling end to the Melbourne Stars&#39; regular season, guiding them into the Big Bash League (BBL) finals. Maxwell&rsquo;s blistering 76 not out off 32 balls helped the Stars to a dominant victory over Hobart Hurricanes at the MCG, securing a fourth-place finish and a spot in the finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stars needed a win to leapfrog Perth Scorchers into the top four, and they delivered with ease, defeating a Hurricanes side with little to play for after already securing the top spot in the standings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maxwell, in scintillating form following his remarkable 90 in the previous game against the Renegades, got the crowd on their feet early, blasting a six on his fourth delivery. His partnership with Beau Webster, who also scored a half-century, pushed the Stars past 200, a total that would prove too much for the Hurricanes. Maxwell added three more sixes, including one off quick Cameron Gannon, as the Stars finished with 204/4 from their 20 overs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite struggling with the bat earlier in the season, the Stars showed immense improvement, particularly at the top of the order. Openers Sam Harper and Thomas Rogers provided a solid platform, with Harper&rsquo;s four early boundaries setting the tone. However, both were dismissed during the powerplay, with Rogers falling to Nathan Ellis&rsquo; clever change of pace and Harper being trapped lbw by spinner Nikhil Chaudhary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marcus Stoinis, who had been inconsistent throughout the season, tried to maintain the momentum with a quick-fire 32 from 19 balls, but once he fell, it was Maxwell who took over. His fast-paced innings, full of powerful hitting, ensured the Stars set a challenging target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hobart&rsquo;s bowling attack, including a mix of experimental selections and injuries, struggled to contain Maxwell&rsquo;s onslaught. Riley Meredith was absent, and Nathan Ellis bowled only one over due to a sore groin. Chris Jordan, making his return from a back injury, also faced difficulties as Maxwell took control in the later stages. Despite some promising moments from debutant Marcus Bean and Gannon, both bowlers found themselves on the receiving end of Maxwell&rsquo;s power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hurricanes&rsquo; chase got off to a flying start with Mitchell Owen, who struck a couple of big sixes early on and raced to 34 from just 10 balls. However, his momentum slowed, and he eventually holed out for 38. The Hurricanes&rsquo; slim hopes of chasing down the target were effectively ended when Steketee claimed key wickets, finishing with figures of 4/24 from just 3.3 overs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellis top-scored for the Hurricanes with a rapid 40 at the end, but his dismissal to Maxwell sealed the Stars&#39; comprehensive victory. With this win, the Melbourne Stars secured a spot in the knockout final against Sydney Thunder at the Showgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s stellar performance not only ensured the Stars&rsquo; progression to the finals for the first time since BBL 09 but also provided a welcome boost for the veteran, whose Test career now looks uncertain after being overlooked for the Sri Lanka tour. The Stars, having turned around a disappointing start to the season, will head into the finals with confidence after five consecutive wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hurricanes, on the other hand, will play in the Qualifier against Sydney Sixers, after securing the top spot in the standings, but their performance in this match will be a concern heading into the business end of the competition.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>Rishabh Pant is set to take over the reins as captain of the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) ahead of the 2025 IPL season. Pant, who was acquired by LSG for a record INR 27 crore (approximately US$ 3.21 million) during the November 2024 mega auction, becomes the most expensive player in IPL history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant&rsquo;s appointment marks a significant change for LSG, who have been in search of a new captain after India wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul led the franchise for the first three seasons. Under Rahul&#39;s leadership, LSG made the playoffs in both their inaugural seasons (2022 and 2023), but fell short of reaching the final on either occasion. The 2024 season proved to be a disappointing one for the franchise, as they finished seventh on the points table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be Pant&rsquo;s second stint as a captain in the IPL, having previously led Delhi Capitals (DC) from 2021 to 2022. However, his time at DC ended on a somewhat strained note after contract talks broke down, leading Pant to enter the 2024 auction. Despite being part of DC since 2016, Pant opted to move on after DC expressed interest in retaining him but were not fully committed to keeping him as captain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For LSG, the decision to hand Pant the captaincy was part of their plans to rejuvenate the team following a lackluster 2024 season. Before the auction, LSG had retained five key players: Nicholas Pooran, Ravi Bishnoi, Mayank Yadav, Ayush Badoni, and Mohsin Khan. However, the franchise was keen to find an Indian leader to replace Rahul, with Pant and Shreyas Iyer topping their list of potential candidates. After an intense bidding battle with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), LSG secured Pant by raising their initial bid from INR 20.75 crore to INR 27 crore, eventually outbidding Delhi Capitals, who attempted to use their right-to-match card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant, who was a central figure for DC in the IPL, had captained the team from 2021, except during the 2023 season when a life-threatening car accident kept him out of action. His leadership skills and aggressive style of play are expected to benefit LSG as they aim to make a strong comeback in the 2025 season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant&rsquo;s leadership will be bolstered by a revamped LSG squad, which includes experienced international players like David Miller, Mitchell Marsh, and Aiden Markram, alongside Indian pacers Akash Deep and Avesh Khan. While Pooran, Marsh, Markram, and Miller were also considered for the captaincy role, Pant&rsquo;s strong presence and experience made him the ideal choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant will now work closely with head coach Justin Langer and new team mentor Zaheer Khan. Pant and Langer have previously interacted during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, and their partnership will be one to watch in IPL 2025 as they aim to guide LSG to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                "<p>In a high-scoring thriller that saw over 650 runs scored, Karnataka triumphed over Vidarbha to clinch the 2025 Vijay Hazare Trophy in Vadodara. Despite superb centuries from R Smaran and Dhruv Shorey, it was a blistering 42-ball 79 from Abhinav Manohar that made the difference, guiding Karnataka to a thrilling victory in a contest that went down to the wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game turned into a nail-biting finish thanks to Harsh Dubey&rsquo;s quick-fire 63 off 30 balls, which brought the chase within reach for Vidarbha. However, despite his valiant efforts, Dubey ran out of partners, and Karnataka sealed victory when he was dismissed by left-arm seamer Abhilash Shetty, leaving Vidarbha stranded at 637 for 9. This win broke Karnataka&#39;s five-year trophy drought, crowning them champions of the prestigious one-day competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The match had begun with Karnataka at the crease, after being put in to bat first. The early loss of in-form Devdutt Padikkal in the sixth over put pressure on the Karnataka top order. However, KV Aneesh and Mayank Agarwal steadied the ship, with Agarwal contributing a solid 32 before being dismissed by seamer Nachiket Bhute, who claimed two wickets in quick succession to reduce Karnataka to 67 for 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, two relatively inexperienced players, R Smaran and KL Shrijith, stepped up in a remarkable 160-run partnership for the fourth wicket. The pair slowly built a foundation before accelerating in the middle overs, with both players reaching their fifties&mdash;Shrijith off 54 balls and Smaran off 47. Shrijith&#39;s departure in the 38th over brought Manohar to the crease, and he showcased his finishing abilities with a brilliant 42-ball knock that featured pristine hitting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manohar&#39;s onslaught was crucial, as he hit Bhute for a sequence of boundaries, including a six, in the 45th over. He continued to dominate, blasting Thakur for a series of boundaries in the 46th and 48th overs, as Karnataka amassed 83 runs in the final seven overs, finishing with a formidable total of 343 for 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, Vidarbha started the chase briskly, with Yash Rathod falling for 22 early on. Nair and Shorey then put together a promising half-century stand, with Nair in particular showcasing his flair, attacking Prasidh Krishna and Shreyas Gopal. However, Nair&rsquo;s departure for 27 off 31 balls left Vidarbha reeling at 103 for 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shorey continued to anchor the chase, reaching his third successive century in the tournament, but the pressure mounted as Jitesh Sharma and others fell in quick succession. Dubey&#39;s valiant efforts brought Vidarbha closer to the target, but with limited support, he could not pull off the heist as Karnataka&#39;s bowlers held their nerve. Dubey was the last man dismissed, leaving Vidarbha at 637 for 9 as Karnataka celebrated their thrilling victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karnataka&#39;s triumph was built on a balanced team effort, with Smaran&#39;s composed century, Shrijith&#39;s impressive knock, and Manohar&#39;s explosive finishing, backed by clinical bowling and fielding. Karnataka&#39;s win also marked the end of a five-year trophy drought, highlighting the team&rsquo;s resilience and determination in a contest that lived up to its billing as one of the most thrilling finals in recent memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Heather Knight remains optimistic that a shift in format and the introduction of fresh talent will give England the momentum needed to salvage the Ashes series, following a crushing 3-0 defeat in the One Day Internationals (ODIs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Australia&rsquo;s dominant ODI whitewash, England finds itself with no margin for error in the remaining multiformat Ashes series. With the team trailing 6-0, they must win all of the upcoming three T20Is and the day-night Test at the MCG to force a 6-6 draw. Even if the series is tied heading into the Test, Australia would only need a draw to retain the Ashes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve got to keep believing, but we can&#39;t look too far ahead,&quot; Knight said. &quot;In the last Ashes series, we were 6-0 down and managed to turn things around. I think the change of format will be good for us, especially with T20 cricket being one of our strongest formats. A little reset should do us some good.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knight also emphasized the importance of focusing on one match at a time, as England did during the last Ashes series when they managed to build momentum after being down. The inclusion of fresh faces, such as Bess Heath, Dani Gibson, Freya Kemp, and Linsey Smith, for the upcoming T20Is, offers hope of rejuvenating the squad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both teams have something to prove in the T20I format. England&rsquo;s early exit from last year&#39;s T20 World Cup in the UAE, coupled with Australia&#39;s semi-final loss, adds an extra layer of intensity to the upcoming matches. Despite Australia&rsquo;s lack of T20I action since that tournament, Knight does not believe it gives the home side a major advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think they&#39;re a team that plays T20 cricket very well, as are we,&quot; Knight said. &quot;We&rsquo;ve had some excellent T20 performances recently, so the lack of recent matches for Australia may not be as significant as some might think.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next challenge for England will be the pink-ball Test at the MCG, where Kate Cross will be crucial to their preparations. Knight confirmed that Cross, who has been recovering from a back injury, was close to being available for the final ODI but was ultimately held back to avoid further risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Kate felt she was close to playing, but we felt it was too much of a risk given her lack of recent cricket,&quot; Knight explained. &quot;Her injury can flare up at any time, so we&#39;re taking a cautious approach.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With just two days between the end of the ODIs and the first T20I at the SCG, and a four-day gap before the Test, switching between formats will be challenging for the players. However, Knight is confident that the squad is moving in the right direction, with special preparation planned for the Test match players, including Tammy Beaumont and Ryana MacDonald-Gay, who will be attending a camp to prepare specifically for the four-day encounter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia is expected to announce its Test squad on Monday, as the series heads into a crucial phase.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Perth Scorchers&#39; finals aspirations remain intact after a thrilling victory over Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League (BBL), with Cooper Connolly delivering a standout performance under pressure. The win, secured in a tense chase at Optus Stadium, came after Melbourne Renegades&#39; surprising triumph over Brisbane Heat earlier in the day, which revived the hopes of both teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scorchers needed to chase down 162 runs in 18 overs to leapfrog the Renegades, and Connolly&rsquo;s powerful finish helped them achieve the target comfortably in the 17th over. With the crowd of 41,878 roaring, Connolly belted consecutive sixes to seal the victory, finishing unbeaten on 39 from 21 balls, ending both the Strikers&rsquo; and Renegades&#39; season hopes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the victory, the Scorchers&#39; path to the finals remains uncertain. Melbourne Stars can still overtake them for the fourth spot if they defeat Hobart Hurricanes in the BBL season finale at the MCG on Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Connolly&rsquo;s Composure Shines in Key Moment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finn Allen, who has been a hit-or-miss performer for the Scorchers this season, started the chase with a few boundaries, but fell short as he was dismissed early, caught at midwicket. With the innings faltering, Aaron Hardie and Sam Fanning fought to steady the ship. Hardie, in particular, looked determined after a lean season, finding the boundary twice and sending a short delivery into the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the match took a dramatic turn in the eighth over when Fanning was run out following a mix-up, and Hardie was stumped soon after, struggling to connect with a legspin delivery from Lloyd Pope. At 78 for 4, the Scorchers were in a precarious position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s when Connolly took charge, maintaining his composure under pressure. The young batter kept the chase on track, and in a decisive moment, blasted back-to-back sixes off D&#39;Arcy Short to help the Scorchers across the line and keep their finals dreams alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the BBL season heads into its final round, all eyes will be on the Scorchers as they await the outcome of the Melbourne Stars&#39; match, knowing their fate will be decided in the coming days.</p>\r\n"
