                "<p>Beth Mooney is excited about the opportunity to &quot;show off our skills&quot; during the day-night Ashes Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), as Australia looks to complete a perfect tour and secure a 16-0 whitewash over England. Despite the Test not having live Ashes implications, Mooney is keen to embrace the freedom the match provides, allowing the team to play without the pressure of the series outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mooney, who was in fine form during the third T20I with an unbeaten 94 off 63 balls, expressed some disappointment that the Test wouldn&#39;t be contested while the Ashes were still on the line. However, she remains positive, noting that the situation allows Australia to approach the match with a relaxed mindset, focusing on showcasing their skills in the four-day format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s going to be awesome,&quot; Mooney said. &quot;We obviously don&rsquo;t get to pull on the baggy green too often. The pink ball behaves a little bit differently so that&rsquo;ll create some challenges. I&#39;m just really looking forward to the spectacle of the game.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia&#39;s dominance in the series has left them 12-0 up, and Mooney admitted that although it would have been ideal for the Test to have been played earlier with the Ashes still at stake, the team is still eager to perform at their best and enjoy the occasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mooney, who has been keeping wicket in place of Alyssa Healy, confirmed she will bat in the middle order for the Test. Healy, dealing with a foot injury, is working hard to recover and is expected to play as a batter, but Mooney&#39;s role as both wicketkeeper and middle-order batswoman presents a unique challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I take pride in the fact that I can offer the coaching staff and selection panel different options,&quot; Mooney said. &quot;Whether it&#39;s batting order or behind the stumps or in the field. It&#39;ll be a nice challenge for me wicketkeeping and batting in that middle order role.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should Healy return to full fitness, Australia will face a tough selection dilemma. Healy has recently moved down the batting order in Test cricket, and she could return to open alongside Phoebe Litchfield unless selectors opt to accommodate Georgia Voll in the line-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia&rsquo;s squad is also affected by injury, with Sophie Molineux sidelined, leaving a vacancy in the team. Georgia Wareham could be in contention to partner fellow legspinner Alana King, while the pink-ball conditions may bring fast bowler Megan Schutt into the selection conversation. Wareham has only played one Test previously, against India in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ash Gardner, who missed the T20I series due to a calf injury, is expected to be fit and available for selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the series already secured, the final Test at the MCG offers a chance for Australia to add another dominant performance to their record and enjoy a rare opportunity to &quot;show off&quot; their skills in front of a large, enthusiastic crowd.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>Mumbai captain Ajinkya Rahane has praised the performance of Jammu &amp; Kashmir&#39;s fast bowling attack after his team suffered a humiliating five-wicket defeat at home in their Ranji Trophy match. The loss, which leaves Mumbai&rsquo;s qualification for the knockout stages in jeopardy, was set up by a remarkable performance from J&amp;K&rsquo;s pace trio of Auqib Nabi, Umar Nazir Mir, and Yudhvir Singh, who shared all 19 of Mumbai&#39;s wickets across the two innings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rahane acknowledged that his team had misread the pitch conditions at the Sharad Pawar Ground. Initially, he believed the dry surface would offer turn from day two, prompting him to field a side with three spinners. However, the conditions favored swing and seam movement instead, catching Mumbai off guard. As a result, the team struggled with the bat, collapsing to 47 for 7 on the first day and then to 101 for 7 in their second innings. J&amp;K were set a modest target of 205, which they chased down comfortably, leaving Mumbai with just four sessions to spare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When we saw the wicket before the match, it looked really dry,&quot; Rahane said after the loss. &quot;Comparatively, the games we&#39;ve played here previously, this was the driest wicket. We thought three spinners would be the best option, but the ball didn&rsquo;t turn as expected. It&#39;s fine, we weren&rsquo;t up to the mark as a team, and J&amp;K played really well, so they deserved to win.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mumbai&rsquo;s loss puts them in third place in Group A, behind J&amp;K and Baroda, with their qualification for the quarter-finals now uncertain. The top two teams from each group will progress to the knockouts, and with one round of league matches still to go, Mumbai&rsquo;s fate depends on their performance against Meghalaya in the next match, along with the results of J&amp;K and Baroda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the defeat, Rahane was quick to credit J&amp;K&rsquo;s fast bowlers, who bowled long spells and consistently challenged Mumbai&rsquo;s batting line-up. Nabi, Mir, and Singh bowled a combined total of 90+ overs across both innings, frequently testing Mumbai&rsquo;s batsmen with swing, seam, and bounce. In the second innings, they also deployed short-ball tactics to exploit the tail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m happy to see their fast bowlers running hard, bowling in the right areas for a consistent period of time,&quot; Rahane said. &quot;They bowled 8-10 over spells, and that needs courage and good fitness. They were really impressive and showed great character. Credit to them for challenging us in both innings.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mumbai entered the match with strong form, having won four of their last five Ranji games, but the interruption of the white-ball tournaments may have affected their momentum. Furthermore, with the return of international stars Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal, the team had to make several changes, leaving out in-form players like Ayush Mhatre and Angkrish Raghuvanshi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you see our Ranji set-up, we had to make five changes,&quot; Rahane explained. &quot;It&rsquo;s tough to analyze this one match because we had a different team in the first part of the season. But one bad game can happen, and I&rsquo;m not too worried. This is a learning experience for us as a team.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the setback, Rahane remains optimistic about Mumbai&#39;s chances and is hopeful for the future. &quot;There&rsquo;s still a 1% chance for us to qualify. You never know what can happen,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s a learning experience for all of us, especially as we look ahead to a future with red-ball, then white-ball, and then red-ball again. Win or lose, it&#39;s all about learning and getting better.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With their knockout hopes hanging by a thread, Mumbai will need to regroup and deliver a strong performance in their final league match against Meghalaya.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>India has made two key changes to its T20I squad for the ongoing series against England, with Shivam Dube and Ramandeep Singh replacing Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rinku Singh. Reddy has been ruled out of the five-match series due to a side strain, while Rinku is sidelined with lower-back spasms that he sustained during the first T20I in Kolkata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Dube and Ramandeep will join the squad starting from the third T20I match, scheduled to take place in Chennai later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Injury Updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reddy picked up the injury during a training session ahead of the second T20I and will undergo rehabilitation at the BCCI&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru, which is located at the newly opened National Cricket Academy premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Rinku, who was fielding in the opening match of the series, experienced lower-back discomfort and has been ruled out of at least the second and third T20Is. Despite not having a chance to bat or bowl in the first match, Rinku had been named as a backup for the series, and his absence leaves an opportunity for Dube and Ramandeep to join the squad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dube and Ramandeep&#39;s Form:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shivam Dube, who last played for India in August 2024 during an ODI series in Sri Lanka, has had a strong return to competitive cricket after missing the home T20I series against Bangladesh due to a back injury. Dube impressed with the bat during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, amassing 151 runs from five innings at an explosive strike rate of 179.76, while also contributing with the ball, taking three wickets at an economy rate of 9.31. His overall T20I record stands at 448 runs and 11 wickets from 33 matches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ramandeep Singh, who has played just two T20Is for India &ndash; both in South Africa last November &ndash; has also been in good form recently. He totaled 126 runs in six innings during the Vijay Hazare Trophy, with a strike rate of 134.04. Although his recent performance in the Ranji Trophy for Punjab was minimal, his explosive batting abilities make him a valuable addition to the squad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s Dominant Start to the Series:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>India won the first T20I against England by a commanding seven-wicket margin with 43 balls to spare. Despite not having much to do with the bat or ball, Reddy contributed by taking two catches in the field. Rinku, similarly, didn&rsquo;t get an opportunity to bat as India comfortably chased down 133, thanks to a dominant top-order performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Updated T20I Squad:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Suryakumar Yadav</strong> (captain)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Axar Patel</strong> (vice-captain)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Sanju Samson</strong> (wicketkeeper)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Abhishek Sharma</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Tilak Varma</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Hardik Pandya</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Harshit Rana</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Arshdeep Singh</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Mohammad Shami</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Varun Chakaravarthy</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Ravi Bishnoi</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Washington Sundar</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Dhruv Jurel</strong> (wicketkeeper)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Shivam Dube</strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Ramandeep Singh</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With the squad now fully adjusted for the upcoming matches, India will be looking to extend their dominant start to the series as they take on England in Chennai later today.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s spinners ran riot on a spin-friendly wicket as they bowled West Indies out for just 163 in a single session, with Noman Ali&rsquo;s historic hat-trick and six-wicket haul taking center stage. The left-arm spinner&#39;s brilliance helped Pakistan continue their dominance, dismissing nine of the ten West Indies wickets to fall, with debutant fast bowler Kashif Ali claiming the first wicket of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a dismal collapse that saw West Indies reduced to 54 for 8, there was spirited resistance from the lower order. Gudakesh Motie led the fightback, scoring a gritty 55, helping the team recover to a more respectable final total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>West Indies, having won the toss and chosen to bat, were immediately in trouble. Mikyle Louis was dismissed in the second over by Mohammad Rizwan, and debutant Amir Jangoo was struck plumb in front by Sajid Khan, leaving West Indies at 2 for 2. A brief partnership between Kraigg Brathwaite and Kavem Hodge seemed to steady the ship, but Pakistan&rsquo;s spinners soon took control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a stunning spell, Noman Ali grabbed a hat-trick in the 12th over, taking the wickets of Justin Greaves, Tevin Imlach, and Kevin Sinclair. Greaves was caught edging a delivery with extra bounce, Imlach missed a sweep to a straight ball, and Sinclair was beaten by turn as Noman cleaned up the tail, making history with the first-ever hat-trick by a Pakistani spinner in Test cricket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite the top-order collapse, West Indies&rsquo; lower order refused to surrender without a fight. Motie, along with Kemar Roach and Jomel Warrican, combined resilience with flair to push the score past 137. Roach and Motie put on 41 for the ninth wicket before Roach was dismissed, but Motie and Warrican continued to frustrate Pakistan&rsquo;s bowlers with a 50-run partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Motie&rsquo;s half-century and Warrican&rsquo;s entertaining strokeplay ensured that West Indies avoided complete humiliation. It wasn&rsquo;t until just before lunch that Motie missed a slog-sweep off Noman, falling to his off-stump to end the resistance. The session that began with total Pakistan dominance ended on a more neutral note, with West Indies salvaging some pride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pakistan&#39;s spinners, led by Noman Ali&#39;s historic performance, were the architects of West Indies&#39; downfall, but the resilience shown by Motie and the lower order ensured a valiant fightback, setting the stage for an intriguing remainder of the series.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>New Zealand began their Super Six campaign at the ICC Under-19 Women&#39;s T20 World Cup with a narrow 18-run victory over the USA in Bangi on Friday. The match, marked by tight bowling and batting struggles, saw New Zealand post a modest total of 97 all out after being put in to bat by the USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Offspinner Ritu Singh was the standout performer for the USA, claiming remarkable figures of 5 for 15 in 3.5 overs. Despite New Zealand&#39;s batting woes, there were a couple of key partnerships that helped the team reach a defendable total. The opening pair of Kate Irwin and Emma McLeod put on 32 runs, while Hannah Francis (25 off 33) and Rishika Jaiswal (17 off 27) combined for a crucial 34-run stand for the seventh wicket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, none of the New Zealand batters could convert their starts into significant scores, with Singh accounting for three of the top five batters and picking up two more wickets in the final over of the innings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, the USA&#39;s chase faltered early as they lost opener Chetna Pagydyala for a duck on the second ball of their innings. Disha Dhingra briefly steadied the ship with a composed 24-ball 30, but once she was dismissed in the seventh over off Anika Tauwhare, the USA&#39;s middle and lower order struggled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ritu Singh also contributed with the bat, scoring 14, but was run out in the 13th over as the USA&#39;s chase faltered further. New Zealand&#39;s bowlers, led by Irwin and Jaiswal, each took two wickets to dismiss the USA for just 70 runs in the 18th over, securing an 18-run win for the Kiwis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result hands New Zealand a crucial victory as they look to progress further in the tournament, while the USA will need to regroup and make improvements ahead of their next fixture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Mumbai&#39;s financial district witnessed a brief burst of excitement on Thursday morning as Rohit Sharma led a solid start to Mumbai&rsquo;s second innings in their ongoing clash against Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Opening with Yashasvi Jaiswal, the pair quickly wiped out more than half of Mumbai&rsquo;s 86-run first-innings deficit. Sharma played a typically attractive knock, hitting three sixes and two fours. His most notable shots were a hooked six off Umar Nazir and a flat-bat hit down the ground off Auqib Nabi, who eventually dismissed him for 28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Sharma&#39;s departure opened the floodgates as Jaiswal, Shreyas Iyer, Ajinkya Rahane, and Shivam Dube followed suit, and Mumbai found themselves at a precarious 15 for 7. Despite the collapse, Mumbai staged a remarkable recovery thanks to an outstanding century from Shardul Thakur. Thakur&rsquo;s unbroken 163-run partnership with Tanush Kotian has given Mumbai a lead of 188 going into Day 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outcome of this match is crucial, with both teams vying for a playoff spot. A win would bring them closer to the top, though a loss would not necessarily end their playoff hopes. Mumbai has a comparatively easier opponent in Meghalaya, while Jammu &amp; Kashmir faces the challenge of taking on table-toppers Baroda next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in Rajkot, Ravindra Jadeja delivered a stunning performance on his Ranji return, picking up 12 wickets to help Saurashtra secure a comprehensive victory over Delhi. Jadeja&#39;s match-winning effort included a career-best 7 for 38 in the second innings, taking his tally to 12 wickets after his first-innings figures of 5 for 66. His efforts led Saurashtra to a bonus-point win, taking them from the bottom of Group D to third position. Jadeja also dismissed Rishabh Pant in both innings as Delhi was bowled out for just 94, setting Saurashtra a mere 12-run target, which they achieved inside three overs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bangalore, Karnataka&rsquo;s R Smaran, 21, continued his stellar rise with a double-century against Punjab. Smaran, who had struggled for runs earlier in the season, now boasts a remarkable 420-run first-innings lead for Karnataka. His consistency at the Under-23 level and breakthrough performances in domestic competitions have earned him a place in the first-class setup, and this innings could mark a new chapter in his promising career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking ahead to Saturday, Madhya Pradesh&rsquo;s Rajat Patidar will be aiming to convert his unbeaten half-century into a match-winning knock as his side looks to build a sizeable lead against Kerala in Thiruvananthapuram. Patidar, who has seen his stock drop after missing out on a place in India&rsquo;s Test squad last year, could use a strong finish to the domestic season to push for a national call-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, Punjab&rsquo;s Shubman Gill faces a tough challenge against a young Karnataka pace attack after his side was reduced to 24 for 2 in their second innings, still trailing by 420 runs. Gill, who was dismissed in the first innings by an inside-edge off left-arm seamer Abhilash Shetty, will look to steady the ship for Punjab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With key players making their mark across various matches, the domestic cricket season is heating up, and the race for the playoffs is set to intensify in the coming days.</p>\r\n"

However, his tour was in doubt after he injured his thumb during Brisbane Heat&#39;s game against Hobart Hurricanes last Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being driven to the hospital by Heat teammate Daniel Drew, Kuhnemann had his thumb dislocated and put back in place, followed by surgery the next morning to insert a pin in the fracture. His recovery has been quick, and by Thursday, he had bowled eight overs, faced throwdowns from Heat and Queensland bowling coach Andy Bichel, and taken a few catches while fielding, all under the supervision of Heat physio Adam Smith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuhnemann is one of three frontline spinners in the Australia squad, along with Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy. The squad also includes part-timers, with Travis Head being the standout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia&#39;s stand-in captain, Steven Smith, was another injury concern after sustaining an elbow injury during the BBL. Smith, who has a history of elbow problems, injured his right arm&mdash;the same one he had surgery on in 2019&mdash;while fielding for Sydney Sixers against Sydney Thunder. However, he has also been cleared to join the squad after consulting a specialist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the two-match World Test Championship (WTC) series doesn&#39;t affect the final, as Australia has already secured their place in the WTC final with a 3-1 win over India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the visitors are aiming for their first series win in Sri Lanka since 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two Tests will take place from January 29 and February 6, followed by two ODIs on February 12 and 14. These matches will help Australia prepare for the Champions Trophy, starting February 19. Sri Lanka has not qualified for the tournament.</p>\r\n"

Durbar Rajshahi and Dhaka Capitals have revived their campaigns and are closing in on third place, currently held by Chittagong Kings, who have lost three of their last four games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khulna Tigers are fourth at the moment, with a game in hand over the teams below them. However, they&#39;ll regret missing a prime opportunity to beat Rangpur. Sylhet Strikers are still struggling at the bottom with just four points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rajshahi started their Chattogram leg under pressure after their players protested over unpaid salaries by skipping a training session. However, they made a statement by becoming the first team to beat Rangpur this season, defeating them by 24 runs. Barishal, on the other hand, had strong performances, beating Dhaka, Chittagong, and Khulna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top Batter: Tanzid Hasan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dhaka&rsquo;s revival has been led by their openers, especially Tanzid Hasan. He scored 62, 22, and an unbeaten 90 off 54 balls in Chattogram, following up his century against Rajshahi in Sylhet. His seven sixes in the 90* against Chittagong took his total to 29, making him the Bangladesh batter with the most sixes in a single BPL season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chittagong&#39;s Graham Clark impressed with a superb century, scoring 101 off 50 balls against Khulna.

Anamul&#39;s teammate, Yasir Ali, also made an impact with 60 off 32 balls and six sixes in a win against Rangpur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top Bowler: Akif Javed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s Akif Javed has been one of the standout bowlers of the season. He is second on the wicket-taking chart with 15 wickets and an economy rate of 6.59. Javed, 24, has been clocking speeds in the high 140kph range, with notable performances including four wickets against Chittagong and three against Rajshahi, often using the bouncer effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rajshahi&rsquo;s Ryan Burl also shone with a four-wicket haul in their big win over Rangpur. Other top spinners, such as Tanvir Islam, Mohammad Nawaz, Arafat Sunny, and Sunzamul Islam, also had three-wicket hauls during the Chattogram phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unusual Events</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khulna&rsquo;s 19-year-old left-arm spinner, Mahfuzur Rahman Rabby, had an expensive over against Chittagong, conceding 27 runs, the second most of the season behind Kyle Mayers&rsquo; 30-run over against Rangpur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sylhet lost Al-Amin Hossain to injury before their match against Dhaka, but opposition captain Thisara Perera reportedly refused them a replacement player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rajshahi had a tough outing against Chittagong, getting bowled out for just 80, the lowest total in the franchise&rsquo;s history. In that match, Chittagong&rsquo;s Naeem Islam became only the second Bangladeshi batter after Mahmudullah to score a fifty after turning 38.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Table Summary</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rangpur finally suffered their first loss of the season after eight consecutive wins, but they remain four points clear of Barishal in second place. Their defeat to Rajshahi ended an 11-match winning streak dating back to their Global Super League title win in Guyana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barishal&#39;s three consecutive victories have propelled them to second place, almost securing a playoff spot. Chittagong, two points behind in third, faces tough fixtures against Rangpur and Barishal. Khulna Tigers are in fourth place, level with Rajshahi on eight points, but ahead on net run rate. Dhaka, with six points, are still in contention for a playoff spot.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>The Hundred and Major League Cricket (MLC) will avoid overlapping schedules in 2025, ensuring both leagues can secure top male players. While neither league has confirmed dates yet, it&#39;s understood that MLC will run from mid-June to mid-July, finishing about two weeks before the Hundred starts in early August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2024, the two leagues clashed for six days, which hurt both competitions. Many overseas players in the Hundred were delayed by MLC commitments, resulting in last-minute replacements. Additionally, Stephen Fleming left his role as Texas Super Kings coach early to join Southern Brave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hundred will still face some scheduling challenges this year, with a two-week overlap with the Caribbean Premier League, which could affect the availability of West Indies players. MLC&#39;s finals may also clash with the start of the European T20 Premier League (July 15-August 3) in Ireland, the Netherlands, and Scotland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although full fixtures for the Hundred will be released next week, the competition is set for a clear window in August, starting right after the fifth men&#39;s Test against India and finishing with the finals weekend on August 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MLC has appointed Johnny Grave as its new CEO. Grave, who previously worked with CWI and has strong ties to English cricket, is expected to strengthen MLC&#39;s relationship with the ECB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECB has increased the top men&#39;s salary in the Hundred from &pound;125,000 to &pound;200,000 to attract leading players. Last year, the overseas player pool was strong, but Pat Cummins sparked controversy when he admitted he hadn&rsquo;t considered playing in the Hundred, instead signing with the San Francisco Unicorns in MLC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cummins, Steven Smith, and Travis Head were involved in MLC last year, but due to a Caribbean tour clash, they may not be available for much of MLC 2025. They could, however, join the Hundred if they enter the March draft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hundred teams have started talks with overseas players for 2025, with each team allowed one direct signing among their 10 retentions. The retention deadline is February 24, and the draft is set for mid-March, just before the IPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports say London Spirit has secured Kane Williamson as captain and is also eyeing Jamie Smith from Birmingham Phoenix. Southern Brave and Manchester Originals are pursuing Laura Wolvaardt and Amelia Kerr, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CPL will run from August 14 to September 21, preventing male West Indies players from playing in the Hundred. However, the women&rsquo;s CPL, a shorter competition with only three teams, is expected to begin in early September, allowing players to compete in both tournaments.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Jay Shah, the current ICC Chair and former Secretary of the BCCI, has been appointed to the newly formed advisory board of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). This board will replace the club&#39;s long-standing World Cricket Committee, a body that has played a significant role in shaping cricket&#39;s global landscape for the past two decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shah, who was notably absent from the inaugural World Cricket Connects forum held last year at Lord&#39;s, now joins 12 other influential figures as founding members of the new World Cricket Connects Advisory Board. The board will be chaired by former MCC president and cricketing legend Kumar Sangakkara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The announcement was made by MCC on Thursday, highlighting that the second World Cricket Connects forum is set to take place on June 7 and 8, just ahead of the World Test Championship final at Lord&#39;s. MCC Chair Mark Nicholas expressed his enthusiasm about the upcoming forum, stating, &quot;We are looking forward to welcoming many of the game&#39;s most influential figures to debate the most important topics that dominate global cricket.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new advisory board replaces the World Cricket Committee, which had been operating since 2006. The committee held its final meeting last summer after serving as an independent body that provided recommendations on various issues, many of which were adopted by the International Cricket Council (ICC). These included the introduction of the Decision Review System, the formation of the World Test Championship, the introduction of day-night Test cricket, and the proposal of a shot clock to tackle slow over-rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advisory board, unlike the previous committee, will meet virtually throughout the year and gather in person after the symposium in June. MCC officials emphasized that the new group would help shape the annual World Cricket Connects agenda and facilitate meaningful discussions, with the goal of making a lasting impact on the health and future of global cricket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The founding members of the new advisory board include cricketing icons and influential figures across various sectors of the sport. Alongside Shah, the members include Sourav Ganguly, Graeme Smith, Andrew Strauss, England women&#39;s captain Heather Knight, Chris Dehring (CEO of Cricket West Indies), and Sanjog Gupta, CEO of JioStar (Sports). Other members include Mel Jones, Trudy Lindblade (CEO of Cricket Scotland), Heath Mills (Chair of the World Cricketers&#39; Association), and Imtiaz Patel, former SuperSport Chair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Nicholas praised the newly formed group, saying, &quot;An important step has been made in the forming of the World Cricket Connects Advisory Board. We have assembled an impressive group of the best minds in cricket across several different areas relevant to our sport. I am delighted to be working with this experienced group and excited about what we can collectively achieve for the benefit of the global game.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the new advisory board prepares to meet and discuss the most pressing issues in cricket, it promises to play a significant role in shaping the future of the sport at the global level.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>The Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) 2024-25 has reached an exciting phase as Rangpur Riders and Fortune Barishal continue to lead the points table, while the battle for the remaining two playoff spots has intensified during the Chattogram leg of the tournament. With the league reaching its crucial stages, Durbar Rajshahi and Dhaka Capitals have revived their campaigns and are closing in on third place, currently held by Chittagong Kings, who have faltered in recent matches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At present, Khulna Tigers occupy the fourth spot, but they are left to regret missing a golden opportunity to defeat Rangpur. Sylhet Strikers, with just four points, remain at the bottom of the table and are still struggling to make an impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rajshahi&#39;s Revival</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rajshahi&rsquo;s campaign in Chattogram began under a cloud of controversy, as players protested over unpaid wages by skipping a training session. However, the team bounced back in style, becoming the first to defeat Rangpur this season, with a dominant 24-run victory. Barishal, on the other hand, made the most of their Chattogram phase, beating Dhaka, Chittagong, and Khulna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tanzid Hasan&#39;s Sensational Run</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dhaka Capitals&rsquo; resurgence has been spearheaded by opener Tanzid Hasan, who has been in blistering form. His performances in Chattogram were particularly impressive, scoring 62, 22, and an unbeaten 90 off 54 balls in three innings. This followed his century against Rajshahi in Sylhet. With a total of 29 sixes, Hasan has set the record for the most sixes by a Bangladeshi batter in a BPL season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another standout performance, Chittagong&#39;s Graham Clark scored a magnificent century, blasting 101 off 50 balls in a victory over Khulna. Anamul Haque also struck a century, scoring 100 not out off 57 balls against Khulna, although Rajshahi lost that match while chasing 210. His teammate, Yasir Ali, played a crucial role in a win over Rangpur, scoring 60 off 32 balls with six sixes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Akif Javed Shines for Rangpur</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pakistan quick Akif Javed has emerged as one of the revelations of the season. Javed, who currently sits second on the wicket charts with 15 wickets at an economy rate of 6.59, has been a key player for Rangpur. The 24-year-old has impressed with his pace, often clocking speeds in the high 140s, and has taken key wickets against teams like Chittagong and Rajshahi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Rajshahi&rsquo;s Ryan Burl took a pivotal four-wicket haul in their big win against Rangpur. Several top spinners also made their mark in Chattogram, with Tanvir Islam, Mohammad Nawaz, Arafat Sunny, and Sunzamul Islam all taking three-wicket hauls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unusual Events and Controversies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tournament has also been marred by some unusual events. Khulna&rsquo;s 19-year-old left-arm spinner Mahfuzur Rahman Rabby endured a tough outing against Chittagong, conceding 27 runs in a single over, making it the second-most expensive over of the season after Kyle Mayers&rsquo; 30-run over against Rangpur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sylhet&rsquo;s woes continued as they lost pacer Al-Amin Hossain to injury after the toss against Dhaka, with reports suggesting that Dhaka captain Thisara Perera refused them a replacement player, adding further frustration to their campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rajshahi suffered their lowest total in franchise history when they were bowled out for just 80 against Chittagong. In that game, Chittagong&rsquo;s Naeem Islam, at 38, became only the second Bangladeshi batter after Mahmudullah to score a fifty after turning 38.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Playoff Picture</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite Rangpur&rsquo;s first loss of the season, which ended their 11-match winning streak dating back to their Global Super League title triumph in Guyana, they remain in the lead, four points clear of Barishal in second place. Barishal&rsquo;s three consecutive wins have seen them rise to second, inching closer to securing a playoff spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chittagong, currently in third place, are just two points behind Barishal and face tough fixtures against Rangpur and Barishal in the coming days. Khulna, on eight points and tied with Rajshahi, are currently ahead on net run rate. Dhaka, with six points, are also still in the playoff hunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the tournament heads toward its final stages, the competition is intensifying, and every point matters as teams vie for a spot in the playoffs. With Rangpur and Barishal looking secure, the battle for the other two spots is set to go down to the wire.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>Rohit Sharma&#39;s much-anticipated return to the Ranji Trophy after nearly a decade didn&#39;t go as planned, as he was dismissed for just 3 runs off 19 balls in Mumbai&#39;s opening match against Jammu &amp; Kashmir. The Indian opener, who has been under scrutiny following India&#39;s 3-1 defeat in Australia, was caught off the leading edge while attempting a pull shot to a rising delivery from Umar Nazir. His dismissal mirrored two recent Test dismissals, against Pat Cummins at the MCG and Matt Henry at the Wankhede Stadium, raising questions about his form ahead of future Test commitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rohit&#39;s departure came soon after that of Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Mumbai&#39;s batting woes continued as key players Ajinkya Rahane and Shreyas Iyer managed only 12 and 11 runs, respectively. Mumbai&#39;s first innings ended in a mere 33.2 overs, with the team bowled out for just 120. However, their bowlers fought back well, providing hope that the deficit could be kept under 100 runs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Ranji appearance is part of the Board of Control for Cricket in India&#39;s (BCCI) new guidelines, following India&#39;s defeat in Australia, and comes as Rohit&#39;s Test future remains uncertain after he opted out of the Sydney Test. The 36-year-old has reiterated that he has not retired and hopes to continue leading India in Tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shubman Gill and Punjab&#39;s Struggles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bengaluru, Shubman Gill&#39;s return to domestic cricket was equally disappointing, both as a batter and captain. Punjab were bowled out for just 55 runs on a greenish Chinnaswamy deck, with Gill managing only 4 runs before being dismissed caught behind. Punjab&#39;s collapse was largely due to the swing and seam movement, leaving them with little chance of recovering from such a substantial deficit. With Punjab struggling at stumps, they will need a major effort from Gill to salvage even a single point from the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gill&#39;s return to domestic cricket was seen as an opportunity to regain confidence after a lean spell in Australia, where he managed only 93 runs in five innings. His recent performances outside Asia, where he averages just 17.64 across 18 innings since the 2021 World Test Championship final, have come under the microscope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pant&#39;s Short Stay and Jadeja&#39;s Spin Dominance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Rajkot, Rishabh Pant lasted just 10 deliveries before being dismissed by Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, part of Delhi&#39;s collapse to spin. Ravindra Jadeja, thriving in the turner-friendly conditions, took his 35th first-class five-wicket haul as Delhi were bowled out for 188 runs. By stumps, Saurashtra had a slender lead of 25 runs but had already lost five wickets, including that of Cheteshwar Pujara. Pujara, who is not part of India&#39;s Test plans, has had a modest season so far, with his only notable score being 234 against Chhattisgarh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Siddharth Desai&#39;s Near-Perfect 10 and Khaleel Ahmed&#39;s Maiden Five-for</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Ahmedabad, Gujarat&#39;s left-arm spinner Siddharth Desai produced a sensational performance, taking nine wickets in a single session against Uttarakhand. Desai&#39;s figures of 9 for 36 were the best by a Gujarat player in first-class cricket, surpassing Jasu Patel&#39;s previous record of 8 for 21. Desai, who has emerged as Gujarat&#39;s front-line spinner following Piyush Chawla&#39;s departure, was tantalizingly close to a perfect 10, but Uttarakhand&#39;s Vishal Jayswal ended his chances when he was the final wicket to fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Khaleel Ahmed celebrated his maiden first-class five-wicket haul, picking up 5 wickets for 37 runs against Vidarbha. The left-arm seamer, who has been on the fringes of India&#39;s national team, showed great promise with his figures of 15-5-37-5, taking key wickets, including that of Karun Nair, who had been in excellent form during the Vijay Hazare Trophy. This is only Khaleel&#39;s 17th first-class match, with his impressive spell coming after a strong showing in the Duleep Trophy, raising his stock among selectors looking for left-arm seam options in India&#39;s Test squad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Ranji Trophy unfolds, these performances from prominent Indian players highlight the intense competition and challenges they face as they push for places in the national side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has been inducted into the prestigious Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, cementing his place among the country&#39;s cricketing legends. At 43, Clarke received the honour on Thursday, nearly a decade after retiring from international cricket. He becomes the 64th player to be inducted, with two more names to be added later this season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s remarkable career began when he made his first-class debut for New South Wales at just 17 years old. Over the course of his career, Clarke captained Australia to victory in the 2015 ODI World Cup and led the national team in 47 of his 115 Test matches. He scored 8,643 runs in Tests, ranking sixth on Australia&#39;s all-time list, and 7,981 runs in ODIs, where he stands fourth. Clarke&rsquo;s 28 Test centuries also place him sixth in that category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s rise to prominence came swiftly. After impressing with the bat in One Day Internationals, he announced his arrival in Test cricket during Australia&rsquo;s 2004 tour of India, where he was named Player of the Match for his debut 151-run knock in Bengaluru. Despite a brief dip in form and being dropped in 2005, Clarke returned to the fold as an even more formidable player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He became only the sixth Australian to score a Test triple-century, posting an unbeaten 329 against India at the SCG during the 2011-12 series. Clarke followed that with a double century in the same series and two more against South Africa the following year. His standout performances also included a memorable 151 against South Africa in Cape Town in 2011 and a defiant 161 on the same ground in 2014, where he played through a broken shoulder to help Australia reach the No. 1 ranking in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of his most emotional innings came in 2014, when Clarke scored 128 against India in Adelaide just days after the tragic death of his close friend, Phillip Hughes. That match would be Clarke&rsquo;s final home Test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke, who succeeded Ricky Ponting as captain in 2011, led Australia to an Ashes whitewash in 2013-14. His tenure as captain ended after Australia&rsquo;s loss in the 2015 Ashes series in England. At the peak of his career, Clarke was ranked the No. 1 batter in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reflecting on his career and induction, Clarke expressed his pride at joining the Hall of Fame alongside cricketing idols he admired as a child. &quot;Retirement does a lot of things to you,&quot; Clarke said. &quot;When you play at the highest level, people talk about your international career, but for me, it started at six years of age. I retired at 34, so it was my life. It&#39;s still a part of my life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter King, chairman of the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, praised Clarke as a player who &ldquo;defined his generation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Michael&#39;s extraordinary first-class playing career started at just 17 at the SCG - the place where many of his highlights occurred, including a Test triple-century against India in 2012,&rdquo; King said. &ldquo;Michael&#39;s career will forever be remembered fondly by the Australian public and his standing held alongside those at the upper echelon of our game.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to his batting feats, Clarke was also a capable left-arm spinner, taking key wickets throughout his career. One of his memorable moments came in 2008 when he took 3 for 5 in just 1.5 overs against India, helping Australia retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and extend their record-equalling 16-match Test winning streak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s legacy, both as a player and a leader, will forever be etched in Australian cricket history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Abhishek Sharma&#39;s meteoric rise in Indian cricket has been nothing short of impressive. After a blistering couple of years in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the 24-year-old&rsquo;s call-up to the Indian T20I squad was backed by his consistent performances, most notably a match-winning 79 off 34 balls against England in Kolkata. However, despite these successes, Abhishek has faced some struggles, including eight instances of being dismissed for under 20 in his first 12 T20I innings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition for top-order spots in India&#39;s batting line-up is intense, adding pressure on a young player like Abhishek, who is still carving out his place. But the young batter has remained undeterred, attributing his continued success to the guidance and confidence instilled in him by the team&#39;s leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent press conference, Abhishek revealed the role of India&rsquo;s captain and coach in keeping his mindset positive. &ldquo;I have always thought from the start to be a team player,&rdquo; Abhishek said. &ldquo;In India, there will always be a lot of competition when it comes to selection, but when Suryakumar Yadav and Gautam Gambhir tell me to always keep my intent, that was a big moment for me. When the team wants me to do that, then I can do it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He further added that the support from his captain and coach, even during lean patches, has been crucial in maintaining his confidence. &quot;When the captain or coach say this, you get confidence and back yourself.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having worked with some of the game&#39;s greats, including Yuvraj Singh, Brian Lara, and now Gautam Gambhir, Abhishek credits their mentorship for helping him express himself freely on the field. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m very lucky in this. I&rsquo;ve been working with Yuvi paaji at first. Going forward, I had Brian Lara, who really helped me at SRH. Moving forward, Dan Vettori was pretty simple; he just wanted everyone to express themselves, and I think that gave me the freedom to play my shots,&rdquo; Abhishek explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking ahead to major tournaments, Abhishek shared his preparation strategy, which includes simulating match conditions in practice. &quot;I try and face the kind of bowlers I will potentially face in a match. Special mention to Kotzy sir [Sitanshu Kotak] and Abhishek Nayar bhai. Both helped me in the nets to get me similar bowlers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his individual brilliance with the bat, Abhishek was quick to credit India&#39;s spinners for their crucial role in restricting England to a modest total of 132 in Kolkata. He singled out Varun Chakravarthy as a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; for India. &ldquo;If you see the last few series, the way Varun has bowled, he has been a game changer for us. When you get good wickets all around in the T20 format, you have to have that bowler who bowls really well,&rdquo; Abhishek remarked, also praising Ravi Bishnoi and Axar Patel for their contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abhishek&rsquo;s fearless approach to batting and his ability to back his natural game, even in high-pressure situations, have made him a standout performer for India in recent matches. With support from his team and coaches, it seems he is well on his way to becoming one of India&rsquo;s most reliable T20I players.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>India captain Suryakumar Yadav chose to bowl first after winning the toss in the opening T20I of the five-match series against England at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. Dew is expected to play a significant role in the second innings, with the pitch described as &quot;sticky,&quot; potentially aiding the bowlers early on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Team Line-ups and Strategy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&#39;s skipper Jos Buttler, who also preferred to bowl first, unveiled a pace-heavy side for the clash. India, meanwhile, have adopted a spin-friendly strategy, with Axar Patel, Varun Chakravarthy, and Ravi Bishnoi forming a three-pronged spin attack. Additionally, left-arm orthodox spinner Abhishek Sharma adds a slower-bowling option to the line-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&#39;s pace contingent includes Arshdeep Singh, all-rounder Hardik Pandya, and debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy. Senior pacer Mohammed Shami, recovering from ankle surgery and a knee injury sustained during the 2023 ODI World Cup final, is yet to make his return to international cricket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transition and Recent Form</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The series marks a transitional phase for both teams. England&#39;s newly-appointed all-format head coach, Brendon McCullum, oversees his first white-ball match. India, under new head coach Gautam Gambhir, have been building on their T20 success, defeating Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and South Africa since their T20 World Cup victory last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&#39;s record at home in T20I series remains formidable, with no bilateral series losses over the past six years. The hosts also hold a dominant edge over England in this format, having won the last four bilateral series. Their previous encounter in the T20 World Cup semi-finals saw India cruise to a 68-run victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key Moments and Historical Context</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For England, this match at Eden Gardens brings back memories of the 2016 T20 World Cup final, where Carlos Brathwaite famously smashed four consecutive sixes off Ben Stokes in the last over to secure a dramatic win for the West Indies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playing XIs</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>India:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Sanju Samson (wk), 2.

                "<p>With the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy on the horizon, questions remain over whether India captain Rohit Sharma will travel to Pakistan for the traditional captains&#39; call, scheduled tentatively for February 16 or 17 in Karachi. As per ICC protocol, the captains&#39; event is typically held in the host country to kick off the tournament. However, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has yet to receive official communication from the ICC on the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It [Rohit travelling to Pakistan] has not yet been discussed. It is not on the agenda yet,&quot; said Devjit Saikia, the newly-appointed BCCI secretary, speaking to ESPNcricinfo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government Clearance Unclear</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is currently unclear whether the Indian government&rsquo;s approval will be required for Rohit Sharma to travel to Pakistan. Political tensions between India and Pakistan have prevented any bilateral cricket series since 2012, with both teams meeting only in ICC tournaments. While Pakistan has visited India for such events, India has not played any matches in Pakistan since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid Model in Place for Champions Trophy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to India&rsquo;s stance against traveling to Pakistan for their matches, the ICC, in coordination with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), introduced a hybrid hosting model for ICC events through 2027. Under this arrangement, Dubai will host all of India&rsquo;s matches in the Champions Trophy, including any knockouts if the team qualifies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PCB Seeks Standard Captains&#39; Event Protocol</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PCB has reportedly requested the ICC to ensure the participation of all team captains for standard pre-tournament events, including the photoshoot and opening ceremony. The ICC is still finalizing logistics and travel plans for the teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, there is precedent for BCCI officials visiting Pakistan. In 2023, BCCI President Roger Binny and Vice-President Rajiv Shukla attended an official dinner hosted by the PCB during the Asia Cup in Lahore. However, no recent example exists of Indian players traveling to Pakistan in an official capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternative Launch Models Considered</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should logistical or political challenges arise, the ICC may consider an alternative launch model. For instance, the captains&#39; event for the 2024 Men&#39;s T20 World Cup was skipped, and a lighting projection show featuring the captains&#39; images was conducted at the Rockefeller Center in New York City instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compliance with ICC Uniform Rules</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responding to reports of alleged objections by the BCCI to the host nation&rsquo;s name on player jerseys, Saikia clarified that India will adhere to all ICC uniform regulations. &quot;BCCI will follow every uniform-related ICC rule during the Champions Trophy. Whatever the other teams will do regarding the logo and dress code, we are going to follow in true letter and spirit,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As discussions continue, the cricketing world awaits clarity on whether Rohit Sharma will break the long-standing absence of Indian cricketers in Pakistan by attending the captains&#39; call, underscoring the challenges of navigating cricket amidst geopolitical tensions.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Steven Smith feared he had sustained a significant elbow injury last week while throwing during a Big Bash League match, a concern that could have disrupted Australia&#39;s plans for their upcoming tour of Sri Lanka. The injury occurred in the same elbow he had ligament surgery on in 2019, a procedure that required a lengthy rehabilitation process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith, who is set to captain Australia in the two-Test series in Galle with Pat Cummins on paternity leave, immediately worried he had re-injured the elbow. Describing the incident, Smith explained that he had just taken a catch off David Warner, flicked the ball back inside the boundary, and was throwing it in when he felt a sharp pain. &quot;Straight away I thought &#39;oh jeez, that hurt&#39;,&quot; Smith recalled. &quot;That was a similar sort of feeling to when I ruptured my ligament back in 2019, so I was a little bit worried.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After consulting a specialist and undergoing scans, Smith was cleared of any major injury to his repaired ligament. However, he did have some muscle damage and minor discomfort where the ligament meets the bone. Despite this, he has been cleared to join the Australian training camp in Dubai, where he arrived on Tuesday. Smith is planning to resume batting in the next couple of days and is confident he can play with some tape on the elbow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith believes the elbow issue may have been exacerbated by a blow to his shoulder from Jhye Richardson earlier in the BBL, which caused significant bruising and led him to adjust his throwing technique. While his throwing ability may be limited, Smith will primarily be used as a close catcher in the Sri Lanka series, which is expected to feature a lot of spin bowling, so his throwing capacity shouldn&#39;t be a major concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith is also set to begin the Sri Lanka series on the cusp of 10,000 Test runs, having been dismissed just short of the milestone twice during the final Test against India at the SCG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Australian squad, minus injured left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann, has now gathered in Dubai. Beau Webster and Mitchell Starc arrived alongside Smith, and the team is preparing on specially-designed pitches at the ICC Academy to replicate the conditions they expect to face in Sri Lanka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith noted the spin and bounce of the conditions in Dubai, saying, &quot;I was watching a bit there and there was a lot of variation in the spin and some bounce as well. That&rsquo;s the reason we are here, we are able to do what we want with these wickets, try and help guys develop game plans for when it gets extreme. It&rsquo;s going to hold us in good stead for the tour.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An update on Kuhnemann&rsquo;s availability is expected in the coming days after he underwent surgery for a compound fracture-dislocation of his right thumb sustained in the BBL.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>David Warner has played a pivotal role in reigniting the Sydney Thunder&#39;s belief, with coach Trevor Bayliss praising his leadership as the team makes a remarkable BBL comeback. A year ago, the Thunder were facing the prospect of reviewing one of the worst seasons in BBL history, having secured just one win &mdash; the lowest total for any team in a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, under Warner&rsquo;s leadership, the Thunder have surged into third place on the ladder, with a 5-3 record, and secured a top-four spot, setting up a knockout clash with the Melbourne Stars on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner, who is enjoying his first full BBL season, has been a standout performer, scoring the second-most runs of the tournament, including an unbeaten 88 against the ladder-leading Hobart Hurricanes. Had it not been for rain disrupting the Thunder&rsquo;s schedule, Warner could have topped the batting rankings, as the team played one less game than the Perth Scorchers, whose allrounder Cooper Connolly narrowly outscored Warner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bayliss acknowledged the immense value Warner has brought to the team, not just with his bat, but with his leadership and presence. &ldquo;The job he&rsquo;s done as captain is not just about his batting, it&rsquo;s his personality,&quot; Bayliss said. &quot;He&rsquo;s always up for it, he&rsquo;s a positive character. Loud, obnoxious sometimes, but the boys love it. I think it&rsquo;s the confidence he gives his teammates, and their belief that they&rsquo;re good enough to do the job. They&rsquo;re all good players; they sometimes just need that belief. The results have shown this year.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner&#39;s leadership has earned admiration from his teammates, including new recruit Sam Billings. Despite Warner&#39;s sometimes controversial past, including his involvement in the 2018 ball-tampering scandal, Billings sees a different side to the 38-year-old. &ldquo;People have this perception around him, but he&rsquo;s incredible in terms of the conversations he has with individuals and the consistent drive,&quot; Billings said. &quot;You see why he&rsquo;s one of the best players in the world, still at the age of 38. I&rsquo;m learning off him every day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their success, Warner believes the Thunder still have areas to improve ahead of their knockout clash against the Melbourne Stars. The team&#39;s largest partnership, an 89-run stand between Warner and Matthew Gilkes against the Perth Scorchers, ranks only 10th among the season&#39;s biggest partnerships. Additionally, the team lacks a bowler in the tournament&#39;s top 10 wicket-takers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The batters haven&rsquo;t all gelled together and gotten big partnerships,&quot; Warner noted. &quot;We talk about bowling partnerships as well; one has leaked at one end and then the other has taken wickets. We still haven&rsquo;t played a complete game yet, which for me is scary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Thunder prepare for their high-stakes encounter with the Stars at ENGIE Stadium, Warner&rsquo;s leadership and consistency continue to drive the team forward, with their fairytale run through the BBL season still alive and kicking.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>David Warner has been instrumental in revitalizing the Sydney Thunder, with coach Trevor Bayliss crediting the veteran batsman for restoring belief within the team as they make a fairytale run to the BBL finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year ago, the Thunder were reflecting on their worst season in nearly a decade, having won only one match, matching the record for the most unsuccessful season in BBL history. However, under Warner&#39;s leadership as captain, the team has bounced back, finishing third on the ladder with a 5-3 record and securing a top-four spot to face the Melbourne Stars in the knockout stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner&#39;s performance on the field has been exceptional. He is the second-highest run-scorer of the tournament, with an unbeaten 88 against the Hobart Hurricanes standing out as one of the season&#39;s highlights. Despite rain affecting their fixture schedule, which resulted in the Thunder playing one less game than the Perth Scorchers, Warner&#39;s form has been a key contributor to the Thunder&#39;s success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&#39;s not just Warner&#39;s batting that has made a difference. Bayliss highlights his leadership qualities, noting that Warner&#39;s positivity, loud personality, and confidence have significantly boosted the team&#39;s morale. &quot;It&#39;s not just about his batting, it&#39;s his personality,&quot; said Bayliss. &quot;He gives his teammates belief in themselves, and that&#39;s been crucial in turning things around.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New teammate Sam Billings has been impressed by Warner&#39;s leadership, praising his consistency and ability to engage with players. &quot;He&#39;s incredible in terms of the conversations he has with individuals,&quot; said Billings. &quot;You see why he&#39;s one of the best players in the world, even at 38.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the team&#39;s success, Warner believes there is still room for improvement. The Thunder have struggled to build large batting partnerships, with their highest of 89 runs between Warner and Matthew Gilkes against the Perth Scorchers ranking only 10th for the season. Warner also noted that while the team has been effective in patches, they have yet to play a complete game, a prospect he finds both exciting and concerning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Thunder prepare for their clash with the resurgent Melbourne Stars, Warner remains focused on refining the team&#39;s performance to reach their full potential in the finals.</p>\r\n"

The pain arose after he took a catch off David Warner, flicked the ball back inside the rope, and subsequently threw it in. Smith described the pain as reminiscent of the injury that led to his previous surgery, causing initial concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I thought &#39;oh jeez, that hurt&#39;,&quot; Smith recalled. &quot;It was a similar sort of feeling to when I ruptured my ligament back in 2019, so I was a little bit worried for a bit. But scans showed fortunately my ligament is still intact, the one that I got repaired. I&#39;ve got a little bit of muscle damage, and there&#39;s a small millimetre of the ligament on the bone that&rsquo;s doing something.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith also suggested that the issue might have been compounded by a shoulder injury sustained earlier in the BBL, when he took a significant blow from Jhye Richardson. This led him to adjust his throwing technique, possibly putting extra strain on his elbow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the scare, Smith is expected to resume batting soon, with plans to return to the nets in the next couple of days.
