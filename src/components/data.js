            "content": [
                "<p>Afghanistan&rsquo;s star legspinner, Rashid Khan, is set to make his return to One-Day Internationals for the first time since last year&rsquo;s World Cup. Rashid has been named in a 17-member squad for Afghanistan&rsquo;s upcoming three-match ODI series against South Africa in the UAE, marking his long-awaited comeback after months of injury rehabilitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The return of Rashid Khan is a significant boost for Afghanistan&rsquo;s bowling attack, especially as the team will continue to miss the services of mystery spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman. Mujeeb is still recovering from a sprained index finger on his right hand, and as a result, has been ruled out of the series. The team has also opted to leave out wristspinner Noor Ahmad, with chief selector Ahmad Shah Sulimankhil confirming that offspinner AM Ghazanfar, who made his ODI debut earlier this year, will cover for Mujeeb in the South Africa series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rashid&rsquo;s return follows a lengthy absence from international cricket after undergoing back surgery last year, which sidelined him for four months. During that period, he missed multiple assignments, including series against the UAE, India, Sri Lanka, and Ireland. He was also forced to withdraw from the Big Bash League (BBL), Pakistan Super League (PSL), and the SA20, before making his return in Afghanistan&rsquo;s T20I series against Ireland in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his surgery, Rashid has focused on T20 formats, playing in several high-profile leagues, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), the T20 World Cup, the Major League Cricket (MLC), and the Hundred. However, he struggled with back and hamstring injuries, which further delayed his full recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afghanistan&#39;s ODI squad for the series against South Africa also includes uncapped medium-pace bowler Bilal Sami, along with top-order batters Darwish Rasooli and Abdul Malik. While Rasooli has represented Afghanistan in seven T20Is, Malik has played two Tests but is yet to feature in ODIs. Sami has yet to make his international debut in any format. Malik&rsquo;s inclusion serves as cover for opening batter Ibrahim Zadran, who is nursing an ankle sprain that has kept him out of both the ongoing Test against New Zealand and the upcoming ODIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three-match ODI series against South Africa will take place in Sharjah, starting on September 18. This series will be the first-ever bilateral ODI encounter between Afghanistan and South Africa, with the two teams having previously met only in the 2019 and 2023 World Cups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The series also serves as crucial preparation for Afghanistan ahead of the 2024 Champions Trophy, for which the team qualified for the first time after finishing sixth in the league stage of the 2023 World Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Afghanistan Squad for South Africa ODIs:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hashmatullah Shahidi (capt), Rahmat Shah, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ikram Alikhil, Abdul Malik, Riaz Hassan, Darwish Rasooli, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Rashid Khan, Nangeyalia Kharote, AM Ghazanfar, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Bilal Sami, Naveed Zadran, Fareed Ahmad.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>Brendon McCullum&rsquo;s tenure as England&rsquo;s new white-ball head coach officially begins on Wednesday in Kolkata, with the former New Zealand captain promising to bring the same aggressive, entertaining style to the limited-overs format that has characterized his leadership of England&rsquo;s Test team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCullum&#39;s appointment, which was announced back in September, sees him take on the dual role of both red- and white-ball head coach, a position he has now officially stepped into following a successful spell overseeing England&#39;s Test tours of Pakistan and New Zealand. Marcus Trescothick had filled in as interim coach for the one-day team during McCullum&#39;s absence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCullum&#39;s first task is a challenging five-match T20 series against India, who were crowned T20 World Cup champions in 2023, followed by a three-match ODI series against the finalists of the 2023 50-over World Cup. England will then prepare for their Champions Trophy opener against Australia on February 22 in Lahore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking ahead of the first T20I at Eden Gardens, McCullum emphasized the importance of a free-flowing, attacking style of play, rather than focusing solely on victories. &ldquo;Obviously, we want to win every game we play, to try and be successful, and that&#39;s ultimately the mission for us,&rdquo; McCullum said. &ldquo;But our conversations and the language we use within the dressing room are quite different.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCullum highlighted England&rsquo;s powerful batting line-up, which he described as &quot;as powerful as anyone&#39;s in the world,&quot; and expressed his desire to build a cohesive, entertaining team with complementary skills. &ldquo;With the talent we have, there&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t play a really watchable brand of cricket,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the team&rsquo;s formidable bowlers and fielders as additional assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The England white-ball team is currently in the midst of a period of transition, having lost both the 50- and 20-over World Cup titles in 2023-24. However, McCullum&#39;s selections for the upcoming series indicate his intention to unify the Test and white-ball squads, with eight of the 15 players named in the ODI squad having featured in the Test team in 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key figures in McCullum&rsquo;s plans is captain Jos Buttler, who has been a fixture in the England white-ball set-up for years. Despite not having played a Test since 2021, Buttler&rsquo;s leadership is central to McCullum&rsquo;s vision for the team. McCullum, who has known Buttler for years through their time together in the IPL, believes the England captain is entering the prime of his career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;His best years are definitely ahead,&rdquo; McCullum stated. &ldquo;If you can let yourself go a little bit, with nothing to prove other than trying to get the best out of those around you, sometimes that can lift your game up a bit more.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCullum also confirmed that Buttler would relinquish the wicketkeeping gloves to focus on leading the team from the field. Phil Salt is expected to continue in the role behind the stumps, as he did during England&rsquo;s Caribbean tour in 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a double World Cup winner and at the age of 34, Buttler has little left to prove in the white-ball format. However, McCullum is confident that Buttler will thrive in his role as captain and that the next few years will be full of exciting opportunities for the 34-year-old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the series against India presents a tough challenge, McCullum is optimistic about England&rsquo;s prospects. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a tough tour. India are a very good team, particularly in their own conditions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we are very much focused on this series, knowing that it will set us up well for the Champions Trophy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&#39;s fans can expect to see an exciting, attacking style of cricket from the team under McCullum&rsquo;s leadership as they look to regain their momentum and build towards the upcoming Champions Trophy.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>Glamorgan Cricket has appointed Richard Dawson as their interim head coach for the 2025 season, following the sudden exit of Grant Bradburn last month due to allegations of discriminatory behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dawson, who has extensive experience in both coaching and playing, was most recently part of the England Men&#39;s white-ball coaching team. He previously served as head coach of England Under-19s and enjoyed a successful tenure at Gloucestershire, where he guided the team to promotion from Division One in 2019 and led them to a T20 Finals Day appearance in 2020. Dawson also spent time with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), working on the performance pathway since 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m delighted to be joining Glamorgan as head coach for the coming season,&quot; Dawson commented. &quot;I&rsquo;ve got a good idea of how the club works having spent time with Welsh Fire over the years. I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting involved with the players and coaches at the club and building on the success achieved in the 50-over competition last season.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dawson&rsquo;s playing career, which included seven Test caps, was largely spent at Yorkshire, with short stints at Northamptonshire and Gloucestershire. Currently, he is working with the England Lions on their tour of Australia and will be involved in the Women&rsquo;s Premier League before taking up his new role with Glamorgan in March. Dawson will also continue as assistant coach for Welsh Fire during The Hundred competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Wallace, Glamorgan&#39;s director of cricket, expressed his satisfaction with the appointment: &quot;It&#39;s great news for the club that we have been able to appoint a coach of Richard Dawson&rsquo;s standing and quality as interim head coach until the end of the season. We were keen to move quickly and get someone in place for the 2025 season, and we see Richard as the perfect fit to develop the squad and continue to move us forward this season.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dawson&rsquo;s appointment is a key move for Glamorgan as they look to build on their recent successes, including their triumph in last year&rsquo;s One-Day Cup. The club will announce a replacement for the One-Day Cup role in due course.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite acknowledged the challenging conditions in the first Test against Pakistan, where the hosts prepared a dry, spinning pitch from the outset. While Brathwaite didn&rsquo;t shy away from addressing the pitch&rsquo;s impact, he emphasized that it was Pakistan&rsquo;s right to prepare the surface as they saw fit. Looking ahead to the second Test, which begins on January 25 in Multan, Brathwaite challenged his team to adapt better and deliver an improved performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We expect the same type of pitch in the second Test, and we&rsquo;ve got to come better,&quot; Brathwaite said at the post-match press conference. &quot;It was a difficult pitch to bat on for sure. But it&#39;s their decision how they want the pitch. We&#39;ve just got to come good.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the loss, Brathwaite found encouragement in the West Indies&rsquo; resilience throughout the first Test. While Pakistan&rsquo;s spinners, Sajid Khan and Noman Ali, claimed wickets, the standout performer for the visitors was left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican, who finished with remarkable figures of 7 for 32 in Pakistan&rsquo;s second innings. Warrican&rsquo;s match haul of 10 wickets for 101 runs was the third-best by a visiting bowler in a Test match in Pakistan, underlining his hard work and consistency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Jamal has worked extremely hard over the years, and it&rsquo;s good to see him get his first five-wicket haul. His hard work has paid off. He bowled well; he was consistent,&quot; Brathwaite said, wishing Warrican success for the second Test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the captain admitted there were areas for improvement, particularly in their bowling and batting. He noted that West Indies had allowed Pakistan to score an additional 50-60 runs in the first innings due to a lack of pressure on the batters. Brathwaite also pointed out the team&rsquo;s batting struggles, especially in the first innings where the top order failed to fire. He highlighted Alick Athanaze&rsquo;s fourth-innings 55, the highest individual score for West Indies, as an example of how the batters could improve their shot selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We gave them 50-60 runs too much in the first innings because the pitch spun from ball one, and we could have created enough pressure on the batters to get more wickets,&quot; Brathwaite reflected. &quot;Saying that, we also didn&#39;t bat as well as we could. Alick showed us today how easy it can be. You&#39;ve got to be braver in your shot selection.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brathwaite emphasized the need for a more all-round performance in the second Test, which could give West Indies a better chance of winning. Despite the margin of defeat, he believed the gap between the two teams was smaller than the scoreline suggested. Pakistan&rsquo;s strategy of preparing a turning pitch was clear, and both captains confirmed they expected similar conditions for the upcoming match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we could be better with the ball in the first innings. We gave them 50 runs too much, and we didn&rsquo;t bat as well as we could have, especially in the first innings,&quot; Brathwaite said. &quot;Pakistan only batted one session in their second innings too, and I think bowling-wise once we stay consistent in bringing batters onto the front foot, we&#39;ll have a better chance of limiting their first innings total. We&rsquo;ve got to bat better, we&rsquo;ve got to find a better way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The West Indies captain didn&rsquo;t commit to a specific strategy but acknowledged the team&rsquo;s growing use of aggressive tactics in their batting as the match progressed. Some players found success with reverse sweeps, while the most destructive phase with the bat came when the tenth-wicket partnership added 46 runs in just 21 balls, counterattacking Pakistan&rsquo;s spinners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The ball was ragging, so one is going to have your name on it regardless. The pitch was difficult, as you could see. It was very dry before even the game started. So I&#39;m not surprised with the game finishing early,&quot; Brathwaite said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As West Indies prepare for the second Test, Brathwaite is confident that his side can adapt and improve, with a renewed focus on consistency with both bat and ball.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>India&rsquo;s first training session ahead of their T20I series against England, which begins on January 22, was centered around fast bowler Mohammed Shami, whose fitness has been a major talking point over the past year. Shami, who has not featured in international cricket since the 2023 ODI World Cup final, was seen bowling with intensity during the practice session at Eden Gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite recovering from an ankle surgery, Shami had missed out on selection for the Border-Gavaskar Test series due to knee swelling. However, he returned to action on Sunday, bowling for over an hour with his knee strapped. Shami&rsquo;s progress was closely monitored by India&rsquo;s bowling coach Morne Morkel, who ensured that the pacer&rsquo;s fitness was on track for the upcoming matches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shami started his session by marking a good-length area on the practice pitches. He warmed up with a half run-up for over 20 minutes before transitioning to his full run-up. In the nets, Shami bowled to openers Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma, displaying encouraging signs of his fitness. Between his bowling spells, he also worked on short- and long-range catching with fielding coach T Dilip and head coach Gautam Gambhir. Shami concluded his session with a ten-minute spell, bowling at near full tilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 34-year-old pacer&rsquo;s fitness has been a concern for India for the last 12 months. His inclusion in the upcoming T20I and ODI series against England will help the team assess his readiness for the Champions Trophy, scheduled to start on February 19 in Karachi. India&rsquo;s opening match in the tournament is against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shami is expected to lead India&rsquo;s pace attack during the five T20Is and three ODIs against England. Jasprit Bumrah, who is also working on his fitness, is likely to return for the third ODI on February 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside Shami, fast bowler Harshit Rana was also seen at the training session, but Arshdeep Singh was absent. Hardik Pandya was the other prominent player in action, contributing with both bat and ball. Pandya also engaged in power-hitting drills with Rinku Singh and Dhruv Jurel, while Rinku and Tilak Varma faced spin bowlers Varun Chakravarthy, Ravi Bishnoi, and Washington Sundar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The batters were under the guidance of newly appointed batting coach Sitanshu Kotak, ensuring they were well-prepared for the challenges ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Shami&rsquo;s return to action and the team focusing on fitness, India looks set for the upcoming series against England as they gear up for the Champions Trophy in February.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Glenn Maxwell may not be heading to Sri Lanka with the Australian Test squad, but he&rsquo;s ensured a thrilling end to the Melbourne Stars&#39; regular season, guiding them into the Big Bash League (BBL) finals. Maxwell&rsquo;s blistering 76 not out off 32 balls helped the Stars to a dominant victory over Hobart Hurricanes at the MCG, securing a fourth-place finish and a spot in the finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stars needed a win to leapfrog Perth Scorchers into the top four, and they delivered with ease, defeating a Hurricanes side with little to play for after already securing the top spot in the standings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maxwell, in scintillating form following his remarkable 90 in the previous game against the Renegades, got the crowd on their feet early, blasting a six on his fourth delivery. His partnership with Beau Webster, who also scored a half-century, pushed the Stars past 200, a total that would prove too much for the Hurricanes. Maxwell added three more sixes, including one off quick Cameron Gannon, as the Stars finished with 204/4 from their 20 overs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite struggling with the bat earlier in the season, the Stars showed immense improvement, particularly at the top of the order. Openers Sam Harper and Thomas Rogers provided a solid platform, with Harper&rsquo;s four early boundaries setting the tone. However, both were dismissed during the powerplay, with Rogers falling to Nathan Ellis&rsquo; clever change of pace and Harper being trapped lbw by spinner Nikhil Chaudhary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marcus Stoinis, who had been inconsistent throughout the season, tried to maintain the momentum with a quick-fire 32 from 19 balls, but once he fell, it was Maxwell who took over. His fast-paced innings, full of powerful hitting, ensured the Stars set a challenging target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hobart&rsquo;s bowling attack, including a mix of experimental selections and injuries, struggled to contain Maxwell&rsquo;s onslaught. Riley Meredith was absent, and Nathan Ellis bowled only one over due to a sore groin. Chris Jordan, making his return from a back injury, also faced difficulties as Maxwell took control in the later stages. Despite some promising moments from debutant Marcus Bean and Gannon, both bowlers found themselves on the receiving end of Maxwell&rsquo;s power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hurricanes&rsquo; chase got off to a flying start with Mitchell Owen, who struck a couple of big sixes early on and raced to 34 from just 10 balls. However, his momentum slowed, and he eventually holed out for 38. The Hurricanes&rsquo; slim hopes of chasing down the target were effectively ended when Steketee claimed key wickets, finishing with figures of 4/24 from just 3.3 overs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellis top-scored for the Hurricanes with a rapid 40 at the end, but his dismissal to Maxwell sealed the Stars&#39; comprehensive victory. With this win, the Melbourne Stars secured a spot in the knockout final against Sydney Thunder at the Showgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s stellar performance not only ensured the Stars&rsquo; progression to the finals for the first time since BBL 09 but also provided a welcome boost for the veteran, whose Test career now looks uncertain after being overlooked for the Sri Lanka tour. The Stars, having turned around a disappointing start to the season, will head into the finals with confidence after five consecutive wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hurricanes, on the other hand, will play in the Qualifier against Sydney Sixers, after securing the top spot in the standings, but their performance in this match will be a concern heading into the business end of the competition.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>Rishabh Pant is set to take over the reins as captain of the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) ahead of the 2025 IPL season. Pant, who was acquired by LSG for a record INR 27 crore (approximately US$ 3.21 million) during the November 2024 mega auction, becomes the most expensive player in IPL history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant&rsquo;s appointment marks a significant change for LSG, who have been in search of a new captain after India wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul led the franchise for the first three seasons. Under Rahul&#39;s leadership, LSG made the playoffs in both their inaugural seasons (2022 and 2023), but fell short of reaching the final on either occasion. The 2024 season proved to be a disappointing one for the franchise, as they finished seventh on the points table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be Pant&rsquo;s second stint as a captain in the IPL, having previously led Delhi Capitals (DC) from 2021 to 2022. However, his time at DC ended on a somewhat strained note after contract talks broke down, leading Pant to enter the 2024 auction. Despite being part of DC since 2016, Pant opted to move on after DC expressed interest in retaining him but were not fully committed to keeping him as captain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For LSG, the decision to hand Pant the captaincy was part of their plans to rejuvenate the team following a lackluster 2024 season. Before the auction, LSG had retained five key players: Nicholas Pooran, Ravi Bishnoi, Mayank Yadav, Ayush Badoni, and Mohsin Khan. However, the franchise was keen to find an Indian leader to replace Rahul, with Pant and Shreyas Iyer topping their list of potential candidates. After an intense bidding battle with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), LSG secured Pant by raising their initial bid from INR 20.75 crore to INR 27 crore, eventually outbidding Delhi Capitals, who attempted to use their right-to-match card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant, who was a central figure for DC in the IPL, had captained the team from 2021, except during the 2023 season when a life-threatening car accident kept him out of action. His leadership skills and aggressive style of play are expected to benefit LSG as they aim to make a strong comeback in the 2025 season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant&rsquo;s leadership will be bolstered by a revamped LSG squad, which includes experienced international players like David Miller, Mitchell Marsh, and Aiden Markram, alongside Indian pacers Akash Deep and Avesh Khan. While Pooran, Marsh, Markram, and Miller were also considered for the captaincy role, Pant&rsquo;s strong presence and experience made him the ideal choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant will now work closely with head coach Justin Langer and new team mentor Zaheer Khan. Pant and Langer have previously interacted during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, and their partnership will be one to watch in IPL 2025 as they aim to guide LSG to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                "<p>In a high-scoring thriller that saw over 650 runs scored, Karnataka triumphed over Vidarbha to clinch the 2025 Vijay Hazare Trophy in Vadodara. Despite superb centuries from R Smaran and Dhruv Shorey, it was a blistering 42-ball 79 from Abhinav Manohar that made the difference, guiding Karnataka to a thrilling victory in a contest that went down to the wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game turned into a nail-biting finish thanks to Harsh Dubey&rsquo;s quick-fire 63 off 30 balls, which brought the chase within reach for Vidarbha. However, despite his valiant efforts, Dubey ran out of partners, and Karnataka sealed victory when he was dismissed by left-arm seamer Abhilash Shetty, leaving Vidarbha stranded at 637 for 9. This win broke Karnataka&#39;s five-year trophy drought, crowning them champions of the prestigious one-day competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The match had begun with Karnataka at the crease, after being put in to bat first. The early loss of in-form Devdutt Padikkal in the sixth over put pressure on the Karnataka top order. However, KV Aneesh and Mayank Agarwal steadied the ship, with Agarwal contributing a solid 32 before being dismissed by seamer Nachiket Bhute, who claimed two wickets in quick succession to reduce Karnataka to 67 for 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, two relatively inexperienced players, R Smaran and KL Shrijith, stepped up in a remarkable 160-run partnership for the fourth wicket. The pair slowly built a foundation before accelerating in the middle overs, with both players reaching their fifties&mdash;Shrijith off 54 balls and Smaran off 47. Shrijith&#39;s departure in the 38th over brought Manohar to the crease, and he showcased his finishing abilities with a brilliant 42-ball knock that featured pristine hitting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manohar&#39;s onslaught was crucial, as he hit Bhute for a sequence of boundaries, including a six, in the 45th over. He continued to dominate, blasting Thakur for a series of boundaries in the 46th and 48th overs, as Karnataka amassed 83 runs in the final seven overs, finishing with a formidable total of 343 for 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, Vidarbha started the chase briskly, with Yash Rathod falling for 22 early on. Nair and Shorey then put together a promising half-century stand, with Nair in particular showcasing his flair, attacking Prasidh Krishna and Shreyas Gopal. However, Nair&rsquo;s departure for 27 off 31 balls left Vidarbha reeling at 103 for 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shorey continued to anchor the chase, reaching his third successive century in the tournament, but the pressure mounted as Jitesh Sharma and others fell in quick succession. Dubey&#39;s valiant efforts brought Vidarbha closer to the target, but with limited support, he could not pull off the heist as Karnataka&#39;s bowlers held their nerve. Dubey was the last man dismissed, leaving Vidarbha at 637 for 9 as Karnataka celebrated their thrilling victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karnataka&#39;s triumph was built on a balanced team effort, with Smaran&#39;s composed century, Shrijith&#39;s impressive knock, and Manohar&#39;s explosive finishing, backed by clinical bowling and fielding. Karnataka&#39;s win also marked the end of a five-year trophy drought, highlighting the team&rsquo;s resilience and determination in a contest that lived up to its billing as one of the most thrilling finals in recent memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Heather Knight remains optimistic that a shift in format and the introduction of fresh talent will give England the momentum needed to salvage the Ashes series, following a crushing 3-0 defeat in the One Day Internationals (ODIs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Australia&rsquo;s dominant ODI whitewash, England finds itself with no margin for error in the remaining multiformat Ashes series. With the team trailing 6-0, they must win all of the upcoming three T20Is and the day-night Test at the MCG to force a 6-6 draw. Even if the series is tied heading into the Test, Australia would only need a draw to retain the Ashes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve got to keep believing, but we can&#39;t look too far ahead,&quot; Knight said. &quot;In the last Ashes series, we were 6-0 down and managed to turn things around. I think the change of format will be good for us, especially with T20 cricket being one of our strongest formats. A little reset should do us some good.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knight also emphasized the importance of focusing on one match at a time, as England did during the last Ashes series when they managed to build momentum after being down. The inclusion of fresh faces, such as Bess Heath, Dani Gibson, Freya Kemp, and Linsey Smith, for the upcoming T20Is, offers hope of rejuvenating the squad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both teams have something to prove in the T20I format. England&rsquo;s early exit from last year&#39;s T20 World Cup in the UAE, coupled with Australia&#39;s semi-final loss, adds an extra layer of intensity to the upcoming matches. Despite Australia&rsquo;s lack of T20I action since that tournament, Knight does not believe it gives the home side a major advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think they&#39;re a team that plays T20 cricket very well, as are we,&quot; Knight said. &quot;We&rsquo;ve had some excellent T20 performances recently, so the lack of recent matches for Australia may not be as significant as some might think.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next challenge for England will be the pink-ball Test at the MCG, where Kate Cross will be crucial to their preparations. Knight confirmed that Cross, who has been recovering from a back injury, was close to being available for the final ODI but was ultimately held back to avoid further risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Kate felt she was close to playing, but we felt it was too much of a risk given her lack of recent cricket,&quot; Knight explained. &quot;Her injury can flare up at any time, so we&#39;re taking a cautious approach.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With just two days between the end of the ODIs and the first T20I at the SCG, and a four-day gap before the Test, switching between formats will be challenging for the players. However, Knight is confident that the squad is moving in the right direction, with special preparation planned for the Test match players, including Tammy Beaumont and Ryana MacDonald-Gay, who will be attending a camp to prepare specifically for the four-day encounter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia is expected to announce its Test squad on Monday, as the series heads into a crucial phase.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Perth Scorchers&#39; finals aspirations remain intact after a thrilling victory over Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League (BBL), with Cooper Connolly delivering a standout performance under pressure. The win, secured in a tense chase at Optus Stadium, came after Melbourne Renegades&#39; surprising triumph over Brisbane Heat earlier in the day, which revived the hopes of both teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scorchers needed to chase down 162 runs in 18 overs to leapfrog the Renegades, and Connolly&rsquo;s powerful finish helped them achieve the target comfortably in the 17th over. With the crowd of 41,878 roaring, Connolly belted consecutive sixes to seal the victory, finishing unbeaten on 39 from 21 balls, ending both the Strikers&rsquo; and Renegades&#39; season hopes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the victory, the Scorchers&#39; path to the finals remains uncertain. Melbourne Stars can still overtake them for the fourth spot if they defeat Hobart Hurricanes in the BBL season finale at the MCG on Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Connolly&rsquo;s Composure Shines in Key Moment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finn Allen, who has been a hit-or-miss performer for the Scorchers this season, started the chase with a few boundaries, but fell short as he was dismissed early, caught at midwicket. With the innings faltering, Aaron Hardie and Sam Fanning fought to steady the ship. Hardie, in particular, looked determined after a lean season, finding the boundary twice and sending a short delivery into the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the match took a dramatic turn in the eighth over when Fanning was run out following a mix-up, and Hardie was stumped soon after, struggling to connect with a legspin delivery from Lloyd Pope. At 78 for 4, the Scorchers were in a precarious position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s when Connolly took charge, maintaining his composure under pressure. The young batter kept the chase on track, and in a decisive moment, blasted back-to-back sixes off D&#39;Arcy Short to help the Scorchers across the line and keep their finals dreams alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the BBL season heads into its final round, all eyes will be on the Scorchers as they await the outcome of the Melbourne Stars&#39; match, knowing their fate will be decided in the coming days.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape bounced back from a challenging start to the season, securing a commanding 58-run victory over Durban Super Giants in Durban. This win came after a tough run of three defeats, providing the team with a much-needed morale boost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Abell&rsquo;s aggressive half-century and a strong late surge from Marco Jansen set the foundation for a formidable total. The bowlers, led by Liam Dawson, Richard Gleeson, and Ottneil Baartman, all took two wickets each, restricting Durban in their chase and sealing the Eastern Cape&rsquo;s first win of the season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aiden Markram won the toss and opted to bat first on what he considered a &quot;pretty dry surface,&quot; though it proved to be somewhat sluggish. The Sunrisers&#39; innings got off to a rocky start when Naveen Ul Haq dismissed opener David Bedingham early. However, Zak Crawley and Abell steadied the ship in the first half of the innings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noor Ahmad then turned the game on its head, picking up three wickets in just two overs. His double-wicket over in the 10th, including the dismissals of Crawley and Markram, followed by the removal of Jordan Hermann in the 12th over, put the Sunrisers on the back foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the setbacks, Abell fought on, forming a vital 54-run partnership with Jansen for the fifth wicket off just 38 balls. Abell was eventually dismissed for 57 in the 18th over by Noor, who claimed his fourth wicket of the evening. The Sunrisers, however, managed to recover in the final overs, scoring 71 runs in the last six, with Tristan Stubbs contributing 15 off 8 balls. This propelled the total to a competitive 165/5, a target that proved beyond Durban&#39;s reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, Durban Super Giants got off to a solid start with Matthew Breetzke and Bryce Parsons, but a moment of hesitation in a run attempt saw Parsons run out, thanks to a sharp throw from Markram. Kane Williamson, who had played a match-winning knock of 60 in the previous game, fell for just three in Liam Dawson&#39;s first over, with the bowler taking a return catch. Dawson struck again in his next over, trapping Breetzke leg before, leaving Durban at 54/3 at the halfway stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Durban managed to add 50 runs in the next five overs, they lost two more key wickets&mdash;Heinrich Klaasen and Quinton de Kock&mdash;during this period. The Super Giants were left needing a late flurry, similar to Eastern Cape&#39;s strong finish, but wickets continued to fall. Jansen dismissed Jamie Smith, and Gleeson picked up two wickets in a pivotal three-wicket over. With Durban&rsquo;s chase collapsing, Baartman sealed the win for Eastern Cape by cleaning up Keshav Maharaj on the first ball of the 19th over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The victory marked a significant turnaround for the Sunrisers, who will now look to build momentum as they move forward in the competition.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is set to launch the first-ever Women&rsquo;s Bangladesh Premier League (WBPL), which is expected to take place soon after the conclusion of the ongoing men&rsquo;s competition on February 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Nazmul Abedeen Fahim, the BCB director, the WBPL will feature three teams. Each team will compete against the others twice, totaling six league matches, before culminating in a final. This marks a significant step in advancing women&rsquo;s cricket in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The board has been exploring various ways to take women&#39;s cricket forward,&quot; Fahim said. &quot;The idea of a T20 competition for women was something we had in mind, and today we&rsquo;ve decided to launch the Women&rsquo;s BPL.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BCB is currently in discussions with several men&rsquo;s BPL franchises about the potential ownership of the women&rsquo;s teams, and Fahim confirmed that some franchise owners have already shown interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have spoken to a few BPL franchises who are interested in owning women&#39;s teams,&quot; Fahim shared. &quot;We want to see how the women&rsquo;s tournament can impact our T20 cricket, and we are hopeful that it will help progress the women&rsquo;s game in Bangladesh.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fahim also revealed that the tournament would allow only one overseas player per team in the playing XI, with each squad consisting of a maximum of 15 players. This decision comes as a result of financial constraints, as the BCB aims to keep the cost manageable for the teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We won&#39;t allow many overseas players due to financial constraints,&quot; Fahim explained. &quot;Having four overseas players could create financial pressure on the teams, which we want to avoid. Our aim is to give more opportunities to domestic cricketers and enhance the competitiveness of the tournament.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be the first women&rsquo;s T20 tournament to be held in Bangladesh. While women&rsquo;s cricket in the country has traditionally been limited to the one-day league in Dhaka, the BCB recently introduced a women&rsquo;s three-day competition, further highlighting its commitment to the growth of women&rsquo;s cricket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WBPL is expected to provide a major boost to the development of women&#39;s cricket in Bangladesh, offering more playing opportunities and exposure for the country&rsquo;s top female cricketers.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>England Men&rsquo;s Under-19s produced a dominant bowling performance to secure a comfortable five-wicket victory over South Africa Men&rsquo;s Under-19s in the opening Youth ODI at Cape Town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New-ball bowlers Harry Moore and James Minto wreaked havoc with the ball, claiming five wickets between them as the hosts were bowled out for a mere 87 runs. England&rsquo;s chase was guided by opener Ben Mayes, who top-scored with a quickfire 51 from 48 balls, while debutant captain Archie Vaughan contributed 26. The Young Lions successfully reached the target in just 18.3 overs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa won the toss and opted to bat, but their decision quickly backfired as Moore and Minto reduced them to a perilous 33 for six. The tone for an exceptional fielding display was set early when Joe Moores pulled off a sharp catch at backward point to dismiss Adnaan Lagadien, who drove a ball from Moore straight to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minto, who was in fine form, had already removed opener Shaylen Pillay, caught behind by wicketkeeper Thomas Rew, on his way to impressive figures of three for 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spinners Taz Ali and Farhan Ali maintained the pressure, and Worcestershire&#39;s Jack Home, making his debut alongside Vaughan and Aaryan Sawant, wrapped up the innings. Home first dismissed Enathi Kitshini, caught at backward point by Moores, before completing a direct hit run-out of Nqobani Mokoena at the non-striker&rsquo;s end to leave South Africa all out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reply, England&rsquo;s chase was anchored by Mayes and Vaughan, who put together a 64-run partnership for the second wicket. Mayes led the charge, reaching his half-century off 45 balls, while Vaughan provided solid support with 26. Despite a few late wickets, England remained in control throughout the chase, ensuring a comprehensive victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Young Lions will have the chance to clinch the three-match Youth ODI series on Sunday when they meet South Africa again at Western Province CC in Cape Town for the second match of the series.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Rohit Sharma is set to continue as India&#39;s ODI captain, as confirmed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The announcement was made ahead of a scheduled press conference on January 18, where the squads for the upcoming Champions Trophy and the ODIs against England will be revealed. The three-match ODI series against England will be India&#39;s final 50-over games before they begin their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh in Dubai on February 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of the 37-year-old Rohit had come under scrutiny following his decision to stand down from India&rsquo;s XI during the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy earlier this month. However, the star batter clarified that his decision was not related to retirement, urging fans and media not to misinterpret his actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rohit&#39;s recent form has been a topic of concern. During India&#39;s home series against New Zealand, he acknowledged making captaincy errors, which were partly to blame for the team&rsquo;s 3-0 whitewash. In the six Test innings against New Zealand, Rohit managed just 91 runs at an average of 15.16. His form further dipped during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he averaged just 6.20 in five innings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an effort to regain his form, Rohit had joined the Mumbai squad for training sessions ahead of the second phase of the Ranji Trophy. His focus is on rediscovering his best as he looks ahead to leading India in the ODI format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rohit, who ended his T20I career by captaining India to the T20 World Cup title in Barbados last year, now has the opportunity to lead India to another major title&mdash;the ICC Champions Trophy. The tournament will be held in Dubai, where India will play all three of their league-stage games. The venue will also host one of the semi-finals, and possibly the final, should India make it that far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since India&rsquo;s loss to Australia in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad on November 19, 2023, the team has played just six ODIs. The upcoming series against England and the Champions Trophy will be critical as Rohit aims to regain his form and lead India to success on the global stage.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>The Seven Network has stepped in to secure the broadcasting rights for Australia&#39;s upcoming tour of Sri Lanka, just 12 days before the first Test is set to begin. The announcement comes after a period of uncertainty, with no network having acquired the rights to air the two Tests and two ODIs, putting Australian cricket fans at risk of missing out on the series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the first Test in Galle set to start on January 29, Seven will broadcast the entire tour, including all the matches, on its free-to-air stations and via the 7plus app. This will ensure Australian viewers can follow the action, despite the looming clash with the Women&#39;s Ashes Test at the MCG, which will also begin on January 29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joel Starcevic, Seven&rsquo;s head of cricket, expressed excitement about the deal, saying, &ldquo;What this summer has shown us is that Australians absolutely love their cricket, and we cannot wait to deliver even more action as Australia takes on Sri Lanka.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tour marks a historic return for Australian cricket to free-to-air television. Every men&#39;s Test tour has been broadcast in Australia for the past three decades, with the last Test not shown being the 1994 Pakistan tour. This series will be the first non-Ashes full overseas men&#39;s Test tour shown on free-to-air TV in Australia since 1997, when Mark Taylor&#39;s team played in South Africa&mdash;another tour that was broadcast by Seven. In 2023, Seven also aired the World Test Championship final between Australia and India at The Oval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many years, Foxtel has held the broadcasting rights for Australia&rsquo;s overseas tours, having broadcast Test series from India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, including the most recent series in Sri Lanka in 2022. However, Foxtel does not have a long-term agreement with Sri Lanka for regular broadcasting of their Test series involving other teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foxtel is currently in the process of being sold to British-based sports streaming platform DAZN, although the sale is still to be finalized over the first six months of 2025. Meanwhile, Amazon has secured the rights to ICC events for the 2024-2027 cycle, including this year&rsquo;s WTC final, but the streaming giant has yet to enter the realm of bilateral series in Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Seven stepping in, Australian fans can now rest assured that they will not miss a moment of their team&rsquo;s action in Sri Lanka.</p>\r\n"

            "content": [
                "<p>South Africa&#39;s already-depleted bowling stocks have suffered another blow as fast bowler Gerald Coetzee is now doubtful for the ongoing SA20 due to a hamstring issue. Coetzee, who was expected to replace the injured Anrich Nortje in the Champions Trophy squad, was left out of the Joburg Super Kings XI for their match against Pretoria Capitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ESPNcricinfo understands that Coetzee&#39;s hamstring problem has raised concerns about his fitness, and his participation in the SA20 over the next few weeks will be closely monitored. Though no official explanation was given for his omission from the XI, sources suggest that Coetzee had only just returned from an injury layoff. The right-arm fast bowler had been expected to feature on a ground that suits his pace-bowling strengths, raising further questions about his exclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coetzee&rsquo;s recent injury troubles have been well-documented. He made his return to competitive cricket during Joburg Super Kings&#39; last match against Durban&#39;s Super Giants at Kingsmead, which was his first appearance since suffering a groin injury in the Test against Sri Lanka in Durban. That injury had ruled him out of the remainder of South Africa&#39;s international summer, following previous fitness issues including a hip niggle and a 12-week conditioning block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before his latest injury setback, Coetzee appeared fitter than ever. He featured in all four of South Africa&#39;s T20I fixtures against India and claimed 4 for 85 in the first Test against Sri Lanka. Just two days ago, he impressed with figures of 2 for 32 in three overs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coetzee had been in line for a place in South Africa&#39;s squad for the Champions Trophy, with white-ball coach Rob Walter previously confirming that he was being considered to replace Nortje. However, with Nortje now sidelined due to a back problem, Coetzee&#39;s inclusion remains uncertain. Should Coetzee fail to recover in time, Walter will need to explore other options from the reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, South Africa&#39;s squad for the Champions Trophy includes Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Marco Jansen, and Wiaan Mulder. However, with multiple key bowlers already injured, Walter could turn to 18-year-old tearaway Kwena Maphaka or the more recent ODI cap Corbin Bosch if he requires additional pace. Alternatively, he may consider Ottneil Baartman, a death-bowling specialist, though the injury crisis means almost every other bowler is unavailable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa&#39;s fast-bowling ranks have been hit hard this summer, with Nandre Burger ruled out for the season after suffering a lower-back stress fracture and Lizaad Williams recovering from knee surgery. Daryn Dupavillon, who had been playing for Pretoria Capitals, has also been ruled out of the SA20 with a hamstring concern, marking the eighth seamer to fall victim to injury this summer. Other injured players include Ngidi (groin), Coetzee, Mulder (broken finger), Nortje (broken toe, then back), Williams, Baartman, and Burger. While many of these bowlers have returned to action, the mounting injury toll continues to leave the team with limited options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With key players sidelined, the pressure is mounting on South Africa&#39;s remaining bowlers to step up and deliver ahead of the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Matthew Wade hit a match-winning six off the final ball as Hobart Hurricanes pulled off a remarkable chase of 202 to defeat Brisbane Heat in a thrilling encounter at the Gabba. Wade&#39;s heroics kept alive the finals hopes of three teams and ensured a home final for the Hurricanes, who recorded their seventh consecutive victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The match, which had massive implications for the Big Bash League (BBL) finals, saw the Hurricanes successfully hunt down Heat&rsquo;s challenging total, with Wade&rsquo;s six off Xavier Bartlett sealing the win in dramatic fashion. Needing 11 runs off the final over, the Hurricanes reduced the target to just one from the last ball, which Wade dispatched over deep square leg to seal the victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in the match, Brisbane Heat had posted a formidable total, largely thanks to Marnus Labuschagne&rsquo;s excellent 77 off 44 balls in his BBL return. However, the Heat&#39;s efforts fell short after a late collapse, with the Hurricanes&rsquo; strong chase proving too much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding to Brisbane&#39;s woes, left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann sustained a thumb injury late in the game, which could have serious ramifications for his potential inclusion in Australia&rsquo;s upcoming Test squad for the tour of Sri Lanka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was crucial for the BBL finals race, as a Heat win would have eliminated Adelaide Strikers, Perth Scorchers, and Melbourne Renegades from contention. However, the defeat kept those teams&rsquo; hopes alive, ensuring a dramatic finish to the regular season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Owen and Wade Lead the Charge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hurricanes&rsquo; explosive chase was set up by openers Caleb Jewell and Mitchell Owen, who provided a rapid start on a batting-friendly Gabba surface. Owen, promoted to the opening slot this season, continued his hot form, smashing three sixes in the first four overs as the Hurricanes raced to 47 without loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The match was briefly delayed after a fire broke out in the DJ booth in the terraces, forcing nearby fans to evacuate. Despite the interruption, Owen maintained his rhythm, continuing to attack with ferocity. He launched three sixes off legspinner Mitchell Swepson before being dismissed for a quickfire 44 off 20 balls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Charlie Wakim was dismissed for a duck, the Hurricanes kept their momentum with an 81-run partnership between Jewell and Nikhil Chaudhary. Jewell played a brilliant innings, timing several elegant shots through the covers, and the Hurricanes were in a strong position when they entered the Power Surge in the 16th over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the match took a turn as both Chaudhary and Jewell were dismissed during the Surge, leaving the Hurricanes needing 11 from the final over. Wade and Jake Doran held their nerve, with Wade&rsquo;s sweeping six off Bartlett&rsquo;s faster delivery securing a dramatic win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hurricanes&rsquo; victory was not only significant for the finals race but also solidified their place in the top four, guaranteeing them a home final in the upcoming BBL playoffs.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>Stephen Fleming has resigned from his role as head coach of Southern Brave&#39;s men&#39;s team in The Hundred, citing family reasons. Fleming, who succeeded Mahela Jayawardene ahead of the 2023 season, led the Brave to the knockout stages in both of his seasons in charge, though they fell short, losing the eliminator in his first year and the final in 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fleming&rsquo;s departure opens the door for Adi Birrell, Hampshire&#39;s head coach, to take the reins for the 2025 season. As part of the ongoing privatisation of The Hundred franchises, teams are strengthening ties with their host counties, and Birrell&rsquo;s appointment marks a notable shift. He will become the first county head coach to also lead a men&#39;s Hundred team, although several county coaches have served as assistant coaches in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Birrell has enjoyed recent success in franchise cricket, guiding Sunrisers Eastern Cape to back-to-back titles in the SA20 competition. His switch to Southern Brave is part of a broader trend of closer integration between counties and their associated Hundred teams. Birrell&rsquo;s commitment to Hampshire will remain intact during the County Championship and T20 Blast, though he will step down as head coach for the Metro Bank Cup, which runs concurrently with The Hundred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fleming&rsquo;s resignation also helps avoid potential conflicts of interest, as he has long been associated with Chennai Super Kings in the IPL. Last year, Hampshire were sold to the GMR Group, who are co-owners of the Delhi Capitals, and are set to become the majority shareholders of Southern Brave in 2025.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having coached Chennai since 2009, as well as their affiliated franchises in Major League Cricket (Texas Super Kings) and the SA20 (Joburg Super Kings), Fleming explained that his decision to step down was driven by a need to spend more time with his family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I absolutely loved my time at Southern Brave, working in The Hundred and with a great group of people at Utilita Bowl,&quot; Fleming said in a statement. &quot;We got close to winning a couple of times, so it&#39;s difficult to step down, but for family reasons, I need to be able to dedicate more time to being at home this season. I wish everyone at Southern Brave the best for 2025.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giles White, Director of Cricket at both Hampshire and Southern Brave, praised Fleming for creating an excellent environment for players during his tenure. &ldquo;Stephen created an excellent environment for the players, and it has been an enjoyable and successful stint with us&hellip; In his place, we are delighted to welcome Adi Birrell and look forward to seeing him build on the team&rsquo;s success in 2025.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the new season approaching, White and Birrell have until February 24 to finalize the squad for 2025, with teams allowed to retain up to 11 players, including one designated central contract player. Each team can also make one direct overseas signing for the season, with the ECB hopeful that the introduction of a new top salary of &pound;200,000 will attract some of the world&rsquo;s best players to the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fleming&rsquo;s resignation comes amid a busy offseason in The Hundred, with a number of franchises recruiting new head coaches. Justin Langer has replaced Trevor Bayliss at London Spirit, while Ali Maiden (Birmingham Phoenix), Michael Klinger (Manchester Originals), and Lisa Keightley (Northern Superchargers) have taken over in the women&rsquo;s competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the 2025 season approaches, Southern Brave and their new coach, Adi Birrell, will look to build on their recent successes and push for their first Hundred title under his guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                "<p>England returns to Tasmania on Friday with a clear objective: secure victory at Ninja Stadium (formerly Bellerive Oval) to keep their Ashes hopes alive. A loss would see Australia claim the ODI series 3-0, taking a commanding 6-0 lead in the multi-format series, leaving England with a monumental task to reclaim the coveted trophy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&#39;s campaign suffered a significant blow in Melbourne, where they squandered a golden opportunity to level the series. Tentative batting and questionable tactics led to a narrow defeat, a performance that skipper Heather Knight admitted was below par. The visitors now have less than 48 hours to regroup and devise a plan to counter Australia&rsquo;s formidable spin attack, led by Alana King.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&rsquo;s Struggles with the Bat</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite restricting Australia to a sub-200 score in the second ODI&mdash;an achievement not often seen since 2009&mdash;England&#39;s batting faltered, succumbing to King&rsquo;s skillful leg spin. Nat Sciver-Brunt, one of England&rsquo;s key players, acknowledged the need for a mental reset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The skills required are already within us,&rdquo; Sciver-Brunt said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about shifting the mindset, sticking to our strengths, and being proactive without being reckless.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&rsquo;s lower order, led by Amy Jones, struggled to chase 180 in the closing stages. Missteps, including missed opportunities to farm the strike, ultimately cost them the game. Jones has reflected on her role in the defeat, with Sciver-Brunt offering support, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia&rsquo;s Dominance and Adjustments</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia, despite their success, recognize their own shortcomings with the bat. A collapse of 8 for 49 in Melbourne highlighted vulnerabilities they are eager to address. Assistant coach Dan Marsh remains confident in the team&rsquo;s resilience and ability to adapt to conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll scrap and fight no matter what,&rdquo; Marsh said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the depth and skill to push the boundaries, and I expect a better batting performance tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia could field a dual legspin attack, with Georgia Wareham likely to join King on a pitch that appears drier than expected. Marsh hinted that Wareham&rsquo;s skiddy bowling style could provide a new challenge for England&rsquo;s batters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&rsquo;s Selection and Tactics</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England&rsquo;s seamer Kate Cross has rejoined the squad after recovering from a back injury. If deemed fit, she could replace Lauren Filer, who has shown promise but struggled with consistency. England&rsquo;s bowling unit has delivered impressive performances, but a more balanced display with the bat is crucial to their chances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stakes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Victory for Australia would leave them needing just two points&mdash;a T20I win or a draw in the lone Test&mdash;to retain the Ashes. For England, Friday&rsquo;s game is a must-win to avoid falling into an almost insurmountable position.</p>\r\n"

                "<p>In a major setback for the Durbar Rajshahi team, their training session in Chattogram on Monday was canceled after Bangladeshi players protested against unpaid wages by the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) franchise. Several players, speaking under anonymity, confirmed their decision to boycott training after team owner Shafique Rahman repeatedly postponed payment dates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The local players informed team management of their reluctance to attend training early Monday morning.

In contrast, overseas players and coaching staff have received 25% of their fees, disbursed after the team&#39;s fourth match on January 6 against Fortune Barishal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BCB Intervenes, Deadlock Persists</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon learning of the incident, BCB President Faruque Ahmed convened an emergency board meeting via Zoom, which included discussions with Shafique Rahman, Rajshahi captain Anamul Haque, and other players. Despite these efforts, the impasse continued, as confirmed by board director Manjur Alam, who addressed the media in Chattogram on Monday evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The board president called an emergency meeting and spoke directly to the team owners, captain, and players,&quot; Alam said. &quot;Negotiations are ongoing, and we remain hopeful for a resolution. The positive news is that the players are expected to attend practice tomorrow.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payment Regulations and Issues</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BPL governing council mandates that franchises pay players 50% of their fees before the tournament, 25% during, and the remaining 25% post-tournament. Additionally, teams are required to provide the BCB with a bank guarantee of BDT 8 crore (approximately USD 657,000), which was reduced to BDT 3 crore (USD 246,000) following franchise requests. However, only Fortune Barishal has fulfilled this requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ESPNcricinfo has revealed that some Rajshahi players&rsquo; cheques bounced on January 9, prompting them to threaten a boycott of their January 10 game against Khulna Tigers. Shafique Rahman assured payment by January 14, but this commitment also went unfulfilled, leading to Monday&rsquo;s protest. Players have stated they will not participate in Rajshahi&rsquo;s next game against Sylhet Strikers on January 17 unless local players are paid 50% of their fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily Allowances and Growing Frustration</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The franchise&rsquo;s financial mismanagement extends to daily allowances, with players reportedly covering their own expenses from January 5 to 11. Captain Anamul Haque had flagged payment delays as early as December 30, after the team&rsquo;s tournament opener.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We haven&rsquo;t been paid our wages. None of us have,&quot; Haque stated at a post-match press conference. &quot;The BPL has just started, so we don&rsquo;t want to project a negative image of the tournament. Everyone around the world is keeping an eye on BPL.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite attempts to address the issue privately, the atmosphere in the Rajshahi camp remains tense. The players&rsquo; refusal to train or play underscores the growing frustration over the franchise&rsquo;s failure to honor its commitments. As the BCB mediates, all eyes will be on whether the dispute can be resolved before Rajshahi&rsquo;s upcoming match.</p>\r\n"
